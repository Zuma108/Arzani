Task: Embed a “business preview” slider on my homepage

Source: Take the slider component from the “Businesses for Sale” section at https://openfair.co

Goal: Give first-time visitors on the landing page a sneak peek at three key metrics—revenue, profit, and asking price—for a handful of Arzani-listed businesses, without forcing them to log in.

Requirements:

Component: Replicate OpenFair’s main slider (slider-main_component) layout and styling, but restrict each slide to:

Revenue

Profit

Asking price

Content: Pull real data for at least 3–5 businesses currently listed on Arzani.

Integration: Insert this slider just below the hero section of your homepage, ensuring it’s fully responsive.

Behavior:

Auto-advance every 5 seconds, with pause-on-hover.

“View All Listings” button linking to the full Arzani marketplace.

Tracking: Log each step of the implementation (fetching, transforming, embedding) in your project memory so we can review progress.
