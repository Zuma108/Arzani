Building a High-Converting B2B SaaS Landing Page for Arzani.co.uk
Executive Summary of Crucial Landing Page Principles
A high-converting landing page is laser-focused on driving a single action. It presents a clear value proposition, speaks directly to the target audience’s pain points, and removes anything that might distract or confuse. Key principles include having no extraneous navigation, one primary call-to-action (CTA), a compelling headline that grabs attention, copy that emphasizes the benefit to the user, and strong social proof to build trust​
copyhackers.com
. Every element – from the hero section down to the final CTA – should work together to guide the visitor toward conversion. By leveraging conversion psychology (like addressing the visitor’s problems and showcasing credible proof), employing proven copywriting formulas, and following user experience (UX) best practices, Arzani can significantly outperform competitor pages. The end result should be a professional, persuasive landing page that drives qualified B2B leads to click “Get a free valuation.” Key Objectives:
Clarity & Focus: Communicate Arzani’s unique value (AI-powered business buying/selling) in clear, customer-centric language. Eliminate distractions so the only obvious action is to get a free valuation​
copyhackers.com
.
Conversion-Centric Design: Use an intuitive layout with a strong visual hierarchy. Make the primary CTA highly visible (contrasting button, repeated in strategic spots) and easy to act on, especially on mobile devices​
balsamiq.com
​
leadfeeder.com
.
Trust & Relevance: Build credibility through testimonials, trust badges, and data. Ensure the messaging resonates with entrepreneurs and business owners by addressing their specific pains (e.g. uncertainty in valuing a business, difficulty finding buyers) and offering Arzani as the solution.
Immediate Action: Use persuasive copywriting techniques (like AIDA, PAS – detailed below) to hook visitors from the headline, hold their interest by agitating problems, create desire with solution benefits, and spur action with a compelling CTA. Provide tactical, step-by-step guidance and remove friction (simple form, clear next steps) to maximize conversions.
By implementing these principles and iteratively testing improvements, Arzani’s landing page can become a conversion powerhouse that turns a high percentage of visitors into leads.
Core Landing Page Principles for SaaS
In a B2B SaaS context, certain foundational principles will set your landing page up for success:
Single Focus & CTA: A landing page is not a general website page – it exists to drive one primary goal​
copyhackers.com
. Remove the main site navigation menu and any external links that could lead visitors astray​
copyhackers.com
​
balsamiq.com
. All roads on this page should lead to the “Get a free valuation” action. This singular focus (known as maintaining a 1:1 attention ratio) prevents choice paralysis and keeps users oriented on the desired conversion​
copyhackers.com
.
Clear Value Proposition: Immediately communicate what Arzani offers and why it matters. The headline and subheadline (in the hero section) should convey a compelling unique value proposition (UVP) for your target audience. It should be benefit-oriented and neither boring nor overly sensational​
copyhackers.com
. For example: “AI-Powered Business Valuations to Maximize Your Sale – Fast, Free, and Accurate.” This speaks to owners’ desire for a fast, reliable valuation. A strong UVP answers “What is this, who is it for, and how will it help me?” within seconds of landing on the page.
Customer-Centric Messaging: Craft the copy around the needs and language of your audience. Write the way your audience talks and “join the conversation already happening in their heads”​
unbounce.com
. For instance, entrepreneurs might be thinking “How much is my business worth? Can I trust this process?” Use that insight to shape your messaging. Focus on benefits over features – don’t just say “AI-powered valuations,” explain it as “Get an accurate selling price using AI (so you don’t leave money on the table).” The benefit of the offer must be crystal clear at a glance​
copyhackers.com
.
Benefit-Oriented Headline & Hero: The main headline should grab attention and immediately resonate. Strong headlines often either agitate a pain point or promise a solution (or both)​
leadfeeder.com
. For example, a pain-focused headline could be “Unsure What Your Business is Worth?” (taps into a common anxiety), followed by a subheadline that offers a solution: “Get a FREE, AI-driven valuation and find out in minutes.” This approach speaks directly to a problem and gives hope of a solution. Ensure the language is straightforward and accurate – no jargon or vague buzzwords. In B2B, a professional tone is key, but that doesn’t mean the copy should be dry. It should be easy to read and understand for a busy business owner.
Social Proof & Trust Signals: Social proof supports the conversion by easing the visitor’s skepticism​
copyhackers.com
. Include evidence that others have succeeded with Arzani: testimonials from happy users, logos of companies that have listed or sold through Arzani, number of businesses valued or sold, etc. Seeing that peers trust the platform reassures visitors that Arzani is credible. For a B2B marketplace like Arzani, trust is paramount – owners need confidence before engaging. Use at least two forms of social proof (e.g. a testimonial quote and a badge like “Trusted by 500+ UK businesses”)​
balsamiq.com
. We’ll delve into specific social proof elements later.
Minimal Friction: Make it as easy as possible for someone to convert. This means a short, simple form (name and business email may suffice to start) and a clear, prominent CTA button. According to conversion experts, extra form fields or unnecessary steps add friction – for each additional field, you lose some percentage of sign-ups​
cxl.com
​
cxl.com
. So ask only for information that’s truly needed to deliver the free valuation or qualify the lead. You can always collect more details later. The overall page should also load fast and be mobile-friendly (more on that below) – any technical frustrations can tank your conversion rate even if the copy is great.
Consistency & Relevance: Ensure the landing page message matches any ads or emails that drive traffic to it (this is known as message match). For example, if an AdWords ad says “Sell Your Business – Free Valuation from Arzani,” the landing page should prominently echo “Free Valuation” and “sell your business” in the headline. Consistent messaging assures visitors they’re in the right place. Additionally, maintain brand consistency in design (use Arzani’s branding, colors, and tone) so it feels professional and trustworthy. A cohesive, polished look influences the perception of credibility – research shows people quickly judge a site’s trustworthiness by its design quality.
Appropriate Page Length: As a SaaS/marketplace offering something free, the page doesn’t need to be extremely long, but it must contain enough information to address key questions. A general rule: if the offer is low commitment (free, no obligation), shorter copy can work best, whereas bigger asks (paid products, high commitments) often need longer copy​
cxl.com
​
cxl.com
. Here, since “Get a free valuation” is a low-risk offer, we lean towards concise content. However, because selling or buying a business is a significant, considered decision, Arzani should include essential details to build trust. In practice, that means covering the basics (what it is, how it works, benefits, proof, etc.) without overwhelming. Every section should earn its place by addressing a known user question or motivating the user further – no fluff. If a piece of content doesn’t strengthen the case or address a likely concern, consider removing it​
balsamiq.com
​
balsamiq.com
. This keeps the page focused and impactful.
By adhering to these core principles – clarity, singular focus, benefit-driven messaging, social proof, and reduced friction – Arzani’s landing page will create a seamless journey from interest to conversion. Next, we’ll break down each section of the page and how to apply these principles in detail.
Section-by-Section Breakdown
Below is a breakdown of the recommended landing page structure, with each section’s purpose, content, and best practices. We’ll cover how to craft each part of the page from the top (hero) to bottom (final CTA) in a way that specifically speaks to Arzani’s target audience (buyers, sellers, and SMB acquirers) and drives them to request a free valuation.
Hero Section
What it is: The hero section is the top of the page that users see first. It typically includes the main headline, a supporting subheadline, an eye-catching visual or illustration, and the primary CTA (often as a button or simple lead form). This is arguably the most critical part of the page – it forms the visitor’s first impression in seconds. Objectives: Grab the visitor’s attention immediately, clearly state the value proposition, and make the desired action (getting a valuation) obvious. By the time a visitor finishes reading the hero section, they should know what Arzani offers, how it can help them, and be enticed to learn more or take action. Best Practices & Content:
Compelling Headline: Use a concise headline that connects with a core desire or pain of the target audience​
leadfeeder.com
. For example, a headline like “Sell Your Business with Confidence – Powered by AI” speaks to owners wanting confidence in the selling process. Alternatively, a pain-focused headline might be “Tired of Guessing Your Business’s Value?” which hooks those worried about valuation. According to 2025 best practices, an effective headline can do one or more of the following: speak to a pain point, promise a solution, or present an intriguing hook​
leadfeeder.com
. Choose phrasing that resonates most with Arzani’s primary segment (business owners likely looking to sell) while staying professional. Ensure the headline is prominent and easily readable (use a large font and high contrast with the background).
Subheadline or Supporting Text: Directly below the headline, include a brief subheadline (one or two sentences) that provides a bit more context or a specific benefit. This is your chance to cement the value proposition with details. For instance: “Arzani’s AI-powered marketplace helps you buy, sell, or expand a business faster. Get a free, expert valuation and connect with thousands of qualified buyers.” This reinforces what Arzani does (“AI-powered marketplace to buy/sell/expand”), the benefit (“faster”), and the CTA incentive (“free, expert valuation”). Note how it touches on all target audiences: buyers, sellers, and acquirers – but still the primary CTA is oriented to sellers (valuation). If needed, you can split into two sub-points or a short bullet list highlighting 2-3 top benefits (e.g., “Free Valuation: AI-accurate pricing for your business; Faster Sales: 37% quicker closings than industry average​
arzani.co.uk
; Qualified Buyers: Over X verified buyers waiting”). Keep this supporting copy skimmable and benefit-driven – avoid deep technical detail here, save that for later sections.
Primary Call-to-Action (CTA) Button/Form: The hero should prominently feature the action you want the user to take. This could be a bold button labeled “Get My Free Valuation” that scrolls to a form or opens a sign-up modal. Alternatively (especially on desktop), you might place a lead capture form right in the hero for immediacy – for example, a field for name, business name, and email, with a submit button “Get My Free Valuation”. Many B2B landing pages find that putting a short form above the fold can boost conversion for ready visitors, while others prefer a button that leads to the form to avoid intimidating people with fields too soon. You can test which works best (more on A/B testing later). Whichever approach, make sure the CTA stands out: use a contrasting color that aligns with Arzani’s branding but isn’t used heavily elsewhere on the page (so it catches the eye). The button should look obviously like a button (use a solid fill, not just text)​
balsamiq.com
, and there should be plenty of white space around it so it’s not crowded​
balsamiq.com
. The copy on the button should be clear and use action verbs – e.g. “Get My Free Valuation” is better than a generic “Submit”. First-person phrasing (“Get My…”) can sometimes increase conversion by making it more personal, but you can test “Get Your Free Valuation” vs. “Get My Free Valuation” to see which resonates more.
Hero Image or Background: Include a relevant visual that complements the message without stealing focus. For a SaaS/marketplace like Arzani, this might be a professional illustration or graphic – perhaps an image of a business owner reviewing a report, or an abstract graphic representing data/AI, or even a subtle animation of a valuation dashboard (if available). The image should reinforce what the text is saying. For instance, a graphic showing an upward arrow or growth chart could symbolize “business growth/expansion”, appealing to the SMBs looking to acquire. Make sure any text overlaid on an image is still highly legible (use overlay color or shadows if needed for contrast). A/B test different visuals: sometimes a product screenshot (like a peek at the Arzani valuation interface) can build credibility by showing the tool, while other times a more emotional image (like happy entrepreneurs shaking hands on a deal) can add human appeal. Avoid cheesy or irrelevant stock photos, as they can hurt authenticity​
leadfeeder.com
. If possible, use custom imagery or illustrations that match Arzani’s brand style​
leadfeeder.com
. Keep the design clean – the hero area should not feel cluttered. A simple layout with the headline, short text, and one strong image is ideal.
Professional Tone & Branding: The hero is also where you set the tone. Use a professional but inviting tone – you want to convey expertise and trust (since Arzani deals with significant financial decisions) but also approachability. For example, “Designed for UK Small Businesses to Buy, Sell, and Scale” (from Arzani’s site) is a clear and professional tagline​
arzani.co.uk
. You might incorporate something similar or reuse phrasing from Arzani’s existing messaging to maintain consistency. Make sure the Arzani logo is visible at the top (usually in the header) to establish brand identity, but consider omitting the standard site header navigation on this landing page, or at least minimizing it (you can use a simplified header with just the logo and maybe a contact link). Copyhackers found that removing global navigation is a standard practice on landing pages to avoid distraction​
copyhackers.com
. If you’re concerned about users needing more info, you can include any necessary links (like “Privacy Policy”) in the footer or as a modal, rather than a full menu, which we’ll cover later​
balsamiq.com
.
Above the Fold vs Below: Aim to have the headline, subheadline, and CTA visible above the fold (i.e., without scrolling) for common screen sizes, especially on desktop and tablet. On mobile, “above the fold” is just whatever fits first, which might just be the headline and part of the subheadline – that’s okay, as long as the user knows to scroll for more. Given that many visitors will be on mobile, consider a design where the first thing they see is the key message and a CTA button near the top (perhaps a sticky header with a “Get Valuation” button or a floating bar). Leadfeeder’s 2025 guide emphasizes ensuring CTA buttons are easy to click on mobile and the page responds well to different screen sizes​
leadfeeder.com
.
In summary, the hero section should immediately answer the visitor’s unspoken questions: “Am I in the right place? What’s in it for me? What do I do next?” If we nail that, we’ve cleared the first hurdle in conversion. For Arzani, that means a sharp UVP about simplifying buying/selling businesses with AI, a clear benefit (free valuation or faster acquisitions), and a bold call-to-action that invites them to get started risk-free.
Problem/Agitation Section
What it is: After the hero, it’s effective to next address the problem or pain points that your audience is facing – and agitate them a bit. This is a classic copywriting approach known as Problem-Agitate-Solution (PAS). In this section, you acknowledge the challenges or frustrations that your target users (buyers, sellers, or acquiring SMBs) experience, thereby building empathy and increasing their desire for a solution. Essentially, you’re saying “We get what you’re struggling with – and it doesn’t have to be that way.” Objectives: Resonate with the visitor’s pain to keep them reading. By explicitly outlining their problem, you create a need for the solution that Arzani provides. This section should make them think “Yes, that’s exactly my situation!” and feel the urgency or emotional impact of not solving it. It softens them for the next section (Solution/Benefits) by setting up a contrast. Best Practices & Content:
Head the Section with Empathy: Use a heading or subheading that identifies the problem. It could be phrased as a question or statement. For example: “The Challenge of Buying or Selling a Business” or “Why Selling a Small Business Is Harder Than It Should Be.” This signals to the reader that you understand their world. It can be a slightly emotional or agitation-oriented headline – e.g., “Are You Struggling to Get a Fair Price for Your Business?” – something that grabs them by reflecting their worry. The tone should remain professional (no fear-mongering or exaggeration), but a bit of urgency or concern is okay to introduce here.
Describe the Pain Points: In a short paragraph or a few bullet points, outline the key difficulties your audience faces:
For sellers: “You’ve worked for years building your business, but when it comes time to sell, it’s confusing to know what it’s worth or where to find serious buyers. Traditional brokers charge hefty commissions, and listing sites might leave you waiting months with no guarantee of a good offer.” This hits on uncertainty of valuation, difficulty finding buyers, and cost – likely pains for a small business owner.
For first-time buyers: “You want to buy a business but the process is opaque – listings don’t give the full picture, due diligence is intimidating, and you worry about overpaying or buying a lemon.” This addresses lack of information and risk.
For SMBs looking to acquire: “You’re looking to expand through acquisition, but sourcing quality opportunities is time-consuming, and evaluating a business’s health is complex without the right data.” This touches on the challenge of finding the right fit and analyzing it.
You can combine these points if you want a unified narrative (since Arzani serves all), focusing on a common theme: the market is fragmented and risky for both buyers and sellers. For instance: “Entrepreneurs and business owners often feel lost and frustrated in the business-for-sale marketplace. As a seller, you might fear undervaluing your company or never finding the right buyer; as a buyer, you worry about hidden issues and overpaying. Without expert guidance, buying or selling a business can be slow, confusing, and costly.” Notice how this phrasing identifies with both groups. Highlighting multiple perspectives can work if done succinctly, but be careful not to muddle the message. If Arzani’s primary goal with this page is lead-gen for sellers (the free valuation offer suggests that), you might skew the language more to the seller’s perspective.
Agitate the Problems: Once you’ve stated the problems, twist the knife gently by explaining the implications if these problems aren’t solved. This is where you build urgency. For example: “If you guess your business’s value wrong, you could leave tens of thousands on the table or scare off buyers by overpricing. Listing on generic marketplaces without guidance can mean months with no serious inquiries. Meanwhile, potential buyers might pass you over for more transparent opportunities. It’s an exhausting, uncertain process when you go it alone.” This kind of copy makes the pain more tangible – it connects the problem to a negative outcome the reader wants to avoid (losing money, wasting time, feeling uncertainty). For buyers: “Without reliable data, buying a business can feel like a gamble — one that could cost your company’s savings or derail your growth plans.” The goal is to make the reader really feel “Yeah, this is a big issue. I need to fix this.” In conversion psychology, this leverages a bit of loss aversion – people are motivated to avoid losses (financial loss, lost time, missed opportunities) as much as to achieve gains. Just be truthful and measured; you want to validate their concerns without resorting to scare tactics. The tone should be empathetic concern, not doom and gloom.
Use Storytelling: One effective way to present the problem is through a short story or scenario. For instance, describe “John, a small business owner, tried to sell his company on his own…” and outline his struggles: undervaluation, tire-kicker buyers, time wasted. Then pivot that story in the next section to how things could be different with Arzani. Humans are wired for stories, and a quick narrative can increase engagement​
leadfeeder.com
. You might also mention how typical solutions fail: e.g., “Maybe you’ve tried getting a valuation from a broker, only to get a wide-ranging estimate and a sales pitch for a 10% commission. Or you listed on a generic site and got flooded with unqualified inquiries. These experiences can make you feel like giving up.” This shows you understand their attempts and frustrations, making them more receptive to a new solution (Arzani).
Visual Aids (if appropriate): You could include a simple graphic here to illustrate the problem, such as an icon of a broken puzzle (to signify a broken process) or a frustration emoji, but often this section is text-driven. If you have data that underscores the problem, that can be powerful too. For example, if there’s a statistic like “80% of small business owners don’t know the true value of their business” or “Typical business listings take 6-12 months to sell,” you could cite that to validate the pain. Just ensure any stat is credible and cited. A small infographic or chart could work if it’s clear and supports the narrative.
Segmentation Note: If Arzani eventually decides to have separate landing pages for “Buy a Business” vs “Sell a Business,” the problem section could be tailored on each (one focusing entirely on buyer pains, the other on seller pains). For the purposes of this unified guide, we’re assuming one combined page, so we touch both perspectives. However, keep in mind that clarity trumps breadth – if combining messages, do so carefully. The copy can address both but should still feel cohesive. If it gets too muddled, prioritize the seller’s pain (since the CTA is a valuation for sellers) and perhaps mention buyer pains more briefly or in passing.
The Problem/Agitation section should make the reader hungry for a solution. When done right, it seamlessly sets up the next part of the page, where you present Arzani as the answer to these problems. The emotional build-up here creates a payoff when you deliver a solution that alleviates those frustrations.
Solution/Benefits Section
What it is: This section introduces Arzani as the solution to the pains described earlier and highlights the benefits and outcomes users can expect. It’s where you pivot from problem to solution – essentially the “Solution” part of Problem-Agitate-Solution. You’ll describe what Arzani does (its features or approach) but more importantly how it solves the problems and what benefits the user gains from using it. This is the persuasive heart of the page where you align Arzani’s value with the visitor’s needs. Objectives: Convince the visitor that Arzani is the ideal solution for them. Alleviate the pains mentioned earlier and paint a picture of a better future (successful sale, smooth purchase, business growth) thanks to Arzani. Here, you are turning interest into desire (in AIDA terms). By the end of this section, the prospect should be thinking, “This is exactly what I need – how do I get started?” (which leads naturally to calls-to-action). Best Practices & Content:
Section Headline – Introduce the Solution: Use a positive, solution-oriented headline. Common approaches include phrasing like “Meet Arzani: [Value Proposition]” or “The Solution: A Smarter Way to Buy and Sell Businesses.” For example: “The Solution – Arzani’s AI-Powered Marketplace Puts You in Control.” This flips the tone from the previous “it’s hard” to now “here’s how it becomes easy.” You could also use a results-oriented headline, like “Sell Your Business 37% Faster with AI and Expert Insights” if you want to highlight a specific outcome (that stat was from Arzani’s FAQ: AI-optimized listings selling 37% faster​
arzani.co.uk
). Make sure the headline clearly ties Arzani to solving the aforementioned challenges.
Value Proposition Paragraph: Start with a short paragraph that encapsulates how Arzani solves the issues. For instance: “Arzani is an AI-driven business marketplace designed to eliminate the guesswork and frustration from buying or selling a small business. We combine advanced analytics with human expertise to give you an accurate valuation, targeted buyer-seller matching, and end-to-end support, so you can close deals with confidence.” This type of copy explicitly counters the problems:
It mentions accurate valuation (solving the “don’t know what it’s worth” issue).
Targeted matching (solving “can’t find the right buyer/Business” issue).
End-to-end support (solving “confusing process” issue). Essentially, you’re listing the core benefits in an introductory way.
Notice the use of power words: “eliminate guesswork,” “with confidence.” These trigger positive emotions and assurance. Keep the language benefit-focused. Joanna Wiebe often reminds that people don’t buy a product, they buy a better version of themselves (or their situation) – in this case, they’re not just buying software, they’re buying peace of mind, speed, profit, and growth. Make those benefits front and center.
Bulleted Benefits/Features: It’s often effective to break out key benefits into bullet points or a short list for easy scanning. Each bullet can be a brief feature-benefit statement. For example:
Free AI-Powered Valuation: Instantly get a data-driven valuation with up to 90% accuracy compared to final sale price​
arzani.co.uk
 – so you know exactly what your business is worth before you go to market.
Qualified Buyers & Sellers: Arzani’s platform uses intelligent matching to connect you with serious buyers (or vetted businesses if you’re buying), saving you time on chasing dead-end leads.
37% Faster Sales​
arzani.co.uk
: Our AI-optimized listings sell significantly faster than the industry average, meaning you can close deals in months, not years.
Expert Guidance & Support: Access step-by-step guidance, due diligence tools, and support from our team of experts at every stage, giving you confidence and clarity throughout the process.
No Commissions, No Surprises: (If Arzani’s model is no commission) Sell your business without paying broker commissions – a transparent process with no hidden fees.
Tailor these bullets to Arzani’s actual strengths. The Arzani FAQ gives hints: it talks about AI analytics, personalized matching, comprehensive due diligence assistance​
arzani.co.uk
, faster sales, accuracy of valuations, etc. Use those unique selling points. Each bullet should clearly state a feature (what Arzani provides) and tie it to a benefit (what result or relief the user gets). The format “Feature: explanation – benefit (so that... )” is a good approach. The text in bold draws attention to the feature, and the rest of the line sells the benefit. For readability, limit to ~3-5 bullet points. You want to cover the major points but not turn it into a laundry list. Think: what are the top 3 or 4 reasons someone should choose Arzani over doing it themselves or using a competitor like Rightbiz? Emphasize those.
Differentiators (Why Arzani): Make it clear why Arzani is different and better. If not already covered in the bullets, explicitly address it. Arzani’s differentiator is the AI-driven, data-rich approach in a space that traditionally might be just classifieds or brokers. You might say: “Unlike traditional marketplaces or brokers, Arzani integrates AI-powered analytics and valuation tools to provide deep insights into business performance, market trends, and growth opportunities – support that traditional brokers simply can’t match​
arzani.co.uk
.” This line, adapted from Arzani’s own materials, positions Arzani as a modern solution versus old-school methods​
arzani.co.uk
. If Rightbiz (the competitor) is known, you can allude to common shortcomings in other services without naming them explicitly: e.g., “Other platforms may let you list a business, but they don’t guide you through valuation or vet buyers. Arzani does.” This creates a subtle competitive comparison and shows Arzani has thought of everything.
Use Concrete Data/Proof: Incorporate any quantitative proof points as we did with “37% faster” or “90% accuracy”. Numbers draw the eye and add credibility. If Arzani has any impressive stats (X number of businesses sold, Y average NPS score, etc.), those could be mentioned either here or in a nearby social proof section. Since this is the benefits section, something like “Over 500 businesses valued in 2025” or “£50M+ in business transactions facilitated” (hypothetical examples) could reinforce that Arzani is established and effective. Just be sure any stat is factual. If Arzani is new and stats are modest, it might be better to focus on the qualitative benefits rather than numbers.
Visual Elements: This section can be paired with visuals to reinforce each benefit. For example, you might have a 2-column layout: text on one side, image on the other, and alternate as you go through bullet points. Some ideas:
A screenshot of the Arzani valuation tool or dashboard (showing perhaps a valuation result or analytics chart) to underline the “AI-powered insight” feature.
An image of a successful sale – e.g., a business “Sold” stamp or a happy business owner – to go with “faster sales”.
Icons: using simple icons for each bullet (like a valuation icon, a speedometer for faster, a handshake for matching, a shield for secure/trust, etc.) can make the list more engaging and easier to scan.
Ensure images are high-quality and professional. Each image/graphic should have a purpose (avoid purely decorative images that don’t add meaning, as they can distract​
cxl.com
). Also, ensure the visuals have consistent style and don’t clash with the page design.
Tie Back to Emotions: While listing benefits, subtly tie back to the emotional aspect. It’s not just about logic (save time, get money) but also feelings: peace of mind, confidence, relief, empowerment. For instance, “so you can close deals with confidence” or “so you feel secure in your decisions” are phrases that speak to emotional outcomes. In B2B, buyers are often driven by avoiding risk and looking competent. Arzani’s solution should make them feel like they are making a smart, safe choice – emphasize that emotional payoff.
After this Solution/Benefits section, the visitor should be nodding along, thinking “This sounds great. This addresses exactly what I’m worried about.” We’ve effectively shown how Arzani wipes away the pain and delivers gains. The next step is often to reinforce credibility (since anyone can claim these benefits, we need to prove it – that’s where social proof comes in). Transition to Social Proof: A nice way to segue is a line like “And it’s not just us saying this – our users’ success stories speak for themselves.” Then you introduce the Social Proof section with testimonials or case studies. This logical flow – problem, solution, then proof – is a time-tested conversion sequence.
Social Proof Section
What it is: The social proof section provides evidence that real people or organizations have used Arzani and achieved positive results. It builds trust by showing that Arzani isn’t just making claims – it has satisfied users backing it up. Social proof can take many forms, but common ones on landing pages are testimonials, case studies, client logos, awards, and ratings. The goal is to reassure and convince skeptics by leveraging the influence of others’ experiences (“if people like me had success, I can trust this service”). Objectives: Establish credibility and reduce anxiety. By the end of this section, prospects should feel “Okay, other business owners have done this and it worked – I believe this can work for me too.” This section plays to the psychological principle of consensus (bandwagon effect) – people tend to follow the actions of others, especially peers or experts. It’s especially important in B2B, where decisions are often high stakes; seeing endorsements can tip the balance from doubt to trust. Best Practices & Content:
Testimonials: Include a few short testimonials from users that reflect each of your key audiences if possible. For example, one from a seller, one from a buyer, etc. A strong testimonial should describe the person’s initial situation or hesitation, and then the result they got with Arzani (ideally with a specific outcome). For instance:
“I was unsure what my company was worth or how to even begin selling it. Arzani’s valuation was a game-changer – they pegged the value perfectly and connected me with multiple interested buyers in just weeks. I sold my business above asking price in 3 months. I couldn’t be happier!” – John D., Small Business Owner.
“After months of searching on other sites, I found a great business to acquire through Arzani in a fraction of the time. Their due diligence tools helped me feel confident about the purchase. We expanded our portfolio with zero hiccups.” – Sarah L., Entrepreneur & First-Time Buyer.
Try to get real quotes from any early users of Arzani (if available). Authenticity is key – use real names, company names (if they allow), locations, etc., to make it tangible. Even better, include a photo of the person next to their quote (a smiling headshot). Seeing a face boosts trust and relatability. Make sure to get permission and stick to privacy rules; since Arzani is UK-based, ensure GDPR compliance for using someone’s name/photo in marketing (likely fine with consent). Format-wise, you could have these testimonials in speech bubble or quote formats, maybe sliding in a carousel if space is tight (but also consider just showing them all vertically if room, to avoid relying on the user to click through). Joanna Wiebe notes that social proof should support the CTA​
copyhackers.com
 – so pick testimonials that specifically address and eliminate common objections (e.g., fear of not selling, fear of complexity). “One week with Rightbiz and I had several interested buyers... Very pleased!” is how Rightbiz shows a quick success​
rightbiz.co.uk
 – Arzani should highlight similar success or satisfaction, ideally even more impressively.
Key Metrics or Achievements: Sometimes social proof is presented as quick stats or achievements. If Arzani has any impressive numbers, consider highlighting them in a visually distinct way (like large bold text or an infographic style). For example:
“500+ businesses sold using Arzani”
“£200M in total deal value facilitated”
“4.9★ average user rating”
“85% of first-time sellers get a deal within 6 months on Arzani”
“Backed by [Industry Association]” or “Awarded Best Fintech Startup 2025” (if true).
These are hypothetical – use whatever Arzani can truly claim. Even something like “Trusted by business owners across the UK – from cafes to tech startups” can work if you don’t have hard numbers yet. The idea is to convey that others have taken this path, and it worked out well.
Customer Logos / Brands: If Arzani already has users or clients that are okay to name-drop, show their logos (especially if any are well-known in their sector). A row of logos of businesses that have been bought/sold on the platform (or investors, or partners) can provide instant trust. For example, Rightbiz might show logos of notable franchises or companies sold through them. Arzani could show recognizable SME logos or at least a variety of business types to signal breadth. Label this section as “Trusted by” or “Our customers include” if using logos. Keep logos monochrome or same size for a clean look, and don’t over-crowd – 5 or 6 is plenty to show social proof without diluting.
Trust Badges/Seals: If applicable, include any badges like certifications, security seals, or affiliations. For instance: “ICO Registered” (for data protection), “GDPR Compliant”, or membership logos of professional bodies (e.g., “Member of the UK Business Brokers Association” if that exists, or a Tech Nation fintech badge, etc.). These elements address trust on a more institutional level, showing Arzani is legitimate and adheres to standards​
leadfeeder.com
. Another example: if Arzani’s valuations are vetted by chartered accountants or something, a badge or note stating “Valuations verified by certified professionals” could help.
Case Study Snippet (optional): If Arzani has a great success story, you could include a very brief case study. E.g., “Case Study: Rebecca, a first-time buyer, used Arzani to purchase her dream business – an e-commerce store. With Arzani’s help, she navigated due diligence and closed the deal 40% faster than the industry norm. ‘I was initially nervous...but their step-by-step guidance turned my fears into assurance’ she says. Today, Rebecca proudly owns a thriving business​
arzani.co.uk
.” This mixes narrative with testimonial. It’s longer, so use sparingly – maybe highlight one standout story that will resonate with many readers.
Format & Design: This section should stand out visually as a testimonial section. Often, landing pages will use a slightly different background color or a quotation mark iconography to differentiate it. For example, a light grey background with italic text for quotes, or a big quote symbol behind the text. Ensure text is still readable. You can use carousel dots or arrows for multiple testimonials, but also consider a static multi-column layout if space permits (e.g., two testimonials side by side). If using logos, you might place them just below or above the testimonials, with a heading like “Trusted by businesses across the UK:” and then logos.
Authenticity: Make sure the tone of testimonials feels genuine. Visitors can sniff out overly generic or fake-sounding quotes. So if you don’t have actual testimonials yet (if Arzani is new), it may be worth running a beta with a few users to gather real feedback, rather than inventing quotes. If you must fabricate or stylize something for the sake of the mockup, keep it realistic and then replace with real ones as soon as possible. The credibility of the whole page hinges on honesty – trust is hard to earn, easy to lose.
According to UX best practices, using at least two forms of social proof is recommended​
balsamiq.com
. For instance, testimonials and trust badges, or testimonials and customer logos. This section, combined with earlier factual claims, should cover that. The presence of both qualitative (quotes) and quantitative (numbers, logos) proof appeals to both emotional and logical validators in the visitor’s mind. After reading the social proof section, an on-the-fence visitor should feel their skepticism diminishing: “These people succeeded with Arzani. This platform is legitimate and effective. I won’t be a guinea pig; I’ll be in good company.” That’s exactly the reassurance needed before they encounter another call-to-action or more details. Typically, right after social proof, you might present more details about features or how it works (to address any remaining questions), and then finally drive to the CTA again. So next, we break down features/benefits in more detail (for those who need more information before converting).
Feature/Benefit Section
What it is: This section provides a more detailed look at Arzani’s features and how they benefit the user. Think of it as an expansion of the earlier solution highlights, often presented in a visually structured way. In SaaS landing pages, this is commonly done as a series of feature blocks or cards, sometimes with icons or illustrations, that each focus on a specific aspect of the service. It’s a chance to educate the prospect on what they’ll get and assure them that the product is robust and thought-through. Objectives: Answer the question “What exactly do I get?” and link each feature to a benefit that matters to the customer. For those who are detail-oriented or not yet fully convinced, this section provides the evidence and specifics to back up the broader claims made earlier. It also helps address secondary questions a lead might have about how the platform works. Essentially, we are reinforcing value and preemptively handling questions by showing the tangible components of Arzani. Best Practices & Content:
Organize by Theme: Identify the core components or pillars of Arzani’s platform. Based on what we know, possible pillars could be: 1) AI Valuation, 2) AI Market Insights, 3) Marketplace Listings & Matching, 4) Secure Data & Transactions, 5) Expert Support/Advisory. Each of these is a “feature set” that can be showcased. Arzani’s site itself lists things like Business Valuation, Market Insights, Brain AI, etc., which suggests some key features​
arzani.co.uk
. For the landing page, you might condense into 3-5 major feature blocks, each with a short title and a brief description.
Feature Title and Description: For each feature, have a short title (could be the name of the feature or a benefit-oriented tagline) and 2-3 sentence description. Example format:
AI-Powered Business Valuation – Get precise insights into your business’s worth. Arzani’s advanced AI analyzes over 100 factors (financials, industry trends, comparables) to deliver an instant valuation with 85-90% accuracy against actual sale prices​
arzani.co.uk
. No more guesswork – you’ll price your business right to attract serious buyers.
Data-Driven Market Insights – Make informed decisions with real-time data. Our Brain AI continuously monitors market trends, buyer demand, and sector performance​
arzani.co.uk
. You receive up-to-date analytics and growth forecasts, so whether you’re buying or selling, you can act at the right time and maximize value.
Smart Buyer-Seller Matching – Reach the right people, fast. Arzani’s marketplace isn’t just a listing directory – it’s an intelligent matchmaker. We promote your listing to buyers who are actively searching for similar opportunities, and we filter inquiries to connect you with serious, qualified prospects (no tire-kickers). Buyers likewise get tailored recommendations. This targeted approach means deals happen faster and with less friction.
Secure & Confidential Transactions – Your data and deal are safe with us. We use enterprise-grade encryption and secure portals for sharing sensitive documents​
arzani.co.uk
. List your business confidentially (you control what info is revealed) and communicate through our platform anonymously until you’re ready. With role-based access controls and compliance with GDPR standards, you can trust that your privacy is protected every step of the way​
arzani.co.uk
.
Expert Guidance and Support – You’re never alone in the process. From valuation to closing, Arzani’s team of experts and AI Assistant guide you. Get answers to your questions via our FAQ or chat, and receive personalized tips to improve your listing (like how to present financials attractively). Our support ensures you avoid pitfalls and follow best practices, making the complex process of buying/selling a business simple and clear.
These are illustrative. Tailor each to Arzani’s actual features. Notice each point ties a feature (AI valuation, matching, security, support) to a benefit (price right, faster deals, privacy, simplicity). Keep the descriptions concise; aim for 40-80 words each. Use positive language and second person (“you”) where appropriate to continue focusing on the user.
Visual Icons or Illustrations: Each feature can be accompanied by an icon or small image that represents it. For example:
A scale or graph icon for Valuation.
A chart or trend line icon for Market Insights.
A network or handshake icon for Matching.
A lock or shield icon for Security.
A headset or person icon for Support.
Using a consistent icon style (line icons or flat icons in Arzani’s brand color palette) will make this section visually appealing and scannable. Another approach is using small screenshots for each feature (if the product has distinct screens for these functions), but that can sometimes clutter the page or be hard to see on mobile. Icons or simple illustrations often communicate more quickly. The swipefile analysis highlighted “Feature Highlights: Clearly displays important features with supporting visuals” as a positive aspect of a landing page​
swipefile.com
, so we should emulate that.
Layout: Often features are laid out in a grid (e.g., 3 across on desktop, stacking on mobile). If you have an odd number like 5, you might do 3 in one row, 2 in the next. Make sure each feature block has some breathing room (whitespace) around it so it’s distinct. Alternatively, you can do a vertical stacked approach, where each feature block spans full width: e.g., icon/title, then text. But that can become a long scroll. A balanced grid or two-column layout is usually better for keeping it compact yet digestible. Also consider alternating sides if using images: e.g., feature 1: icon on left, text on right; feature 2: text on left, icon on right; etc., to create a nice flow.
Link Benefits to Conversion: Subtly remind why each feature matters in terms of the end goal (selling or buying a business successfully). For instance, in the above examples, each ended with an outcome: price right, deals faster, privacy, simplicity, etc. This ensures the prospect sees these not just as “cool tools” but as means to achieve their goal.
Address Unspoken Questions: This feature section is also a good place to answer “How does this work?” types of questions. For example, the security feature addresses “Will my information be safe/confidential?” The support feature addresses “Will I have help or am I on my own?” The matching feature addresses “How will I find the right buyer/business?” Think about common objections or doubts and make sure the features cover them. If there’s an objection that none of these features cover directly, perhaps integrate the answer into one of them or include an extra point. For instance, one might worry “Is this platform for me if I’m just exploring?” Arzani in its FAQ said they have a Basic plan for research​
arzani.co.uk
 – that could be woven into the support or insights feature: e.g., “Even if you’re not ready to sell immediately, Arzani’s insights help you prepare and time your move. (We even offer a free research plan for exploring the market.)”
At this stage, the visitor has learned why Arzani is valuable (Solution/Benefits) and what Arzani includes and does (Features/Details). The combination of these sections should address both emotional and logical considerations. Now, before pushing them to a final CTA, it’s wise to handle any remaining doubts explicitly. That’s where an Objection Handling / FAQ section comes in. It can directly tackle questions or concerns that haven’t been addressed yet. We’ll do that next.
Objection Handling
What it is: The objection handling section is often presented as an FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) or a final Q&A segment on the landing page. It targets the common objections or doubts potential customers might still have after reading the above content. Essentially, you surface those concerns and answer them proactively. This helps prevent the user from leaving the page to seek answers elsewhere (or worse, abandoning due to uncertainty). Objectives: Remove the last roadblocks to conversion by addressing questions of cost, trust, fit, and process. Build additional trust and clarity. A well-crafted FAQ can also reinforce some selling points under the guise of answering questions. By the end of this section, the visitor should have no major lingering questions that would hold them back from clicking the CTA. They should feel “Okay, I have all the info I need and I feel comfortable proceeding.” Best Practices & Content:
Format: Use a clear Q&A format. You can style it like:
Q: [Concern in the customer’s voice]?
A: [Reassuring answer that resolves the concern].
Common practice is to bold the question and have the answer in normal text, or use an accordion component where questions can be clicked to reveal answers (though be cautious with accordions on landing pages; visible Q&A is often better for scanning unless space is an issue).
Common Objections to Address: Think from the perspective of a skeptical business owner or entrepreneur. What might stop them from converting? Here are likely ones for Arzani’s scenario:
“Is the valuation really free? What’s the catch?” – People may suspect that “free valuation” could lead to a sales pitch or requires a commitment. The answer should reassure: Yes, it’s completely free and no-obligation. We offer it as a value-added first step. You can use your valuation whether or not you continue with our platform. Emphasize there’s no hidden fee or requirement to list. This builds trust by showing Arzani is confident in providing upfront value.
“How accurate are these AI valuations? Can I trust them?” – Since AI valuation is a key feature, address its credibility. Answer with facts from Arzani’s data: Our AI valuation tool has been tested on thousands of past sales and is 85-90% accurate compared to final sale prices​
arzani.co.uk
. It considers over 100 factors (industry, financials, trends) to give you a data-backed estimate. While no valuation can predict a sale price with 100% certainty, our system is continually learning and has a track record of reliability. For complete confidence, we recommend providing detailed data – the more info, the more accurate the valuation​
arzani.co.uk
. You might also mention that Arzani can supplement AI with expert review if applicable (e.g., “Our team reviews the AI output to ensure it aligns with market reality.”).
“What if I’m not ready to sell yet? Can I still use Arzani?” – Some visitors might be just exploring, not ready to pull the trigger. Answer: Absolutely. You can use Arzani even if you’re in the research phase. In fact, we offer a Basic (free) plan for market research​
arzani.co.uk
 – you can get a valuation, browse listings, and access industry trends without listing your business or committing to anything. This is perfect for owners who are a year or two away from selling but want to prepare, or for buyers scanning the market. When you’re ready, Arzani will be here to smoothly transition you into the actual transaction. This assures that Arzani is valuable even early on and that there’s no pressure.
“How do you ensure confidentiality? I don’t want competitors or employees to know I’m selling.” – Privacy is huge in business sales. Answer: We understand the need for discretion. With Arzani, you control what information is public. You can list your business anonymously (no identifying details in public) and only reveal sensitive info (like your company name or financials) to vetted buyers under NDA. All user data is encrypted and we never share your personal details without permission​
arzani.co.uk
. Our platform also allows private communication channels between you and interested buyers, so you can explore offers confidentially. If possible, mention any specific feature like “private listing option” or similar.
“What does it cost to use Arzani beyond the free valuation?” – If pricing isn’t discussed elsewhere, someone will wonder. If Arzani’s revenue model is subscription or success fee or whatever, be upfront. Perhaps: Arzani’s core marketplace is free to join and explore. The free valuation is, of course, free. If you decide to list your business, we offer [pricing model: e.g., a simple subscription or a small success fee]. For example, [explain pricing plans briefly, or say “our Standard listing plan is free, and we have premium services available – see our Pricing page for details”]. You might not want to delve deep into pricing on a landing page meant to capture leads, but at least give reassurance that it’s not a huge hidden cost. Many B2B SaaS give a high-level statement like “Affordable plans for businesses of all sizes” or “No commission – just a flat listing fee after valuation” etc., to set expectations. Since one of Rightbiz’s selling points is 0% commission, if Arzani also has a no-commission model, absolutely call that out. Conversely, if Arzani does charge commission, emphasize the value (e.g., “competitive commission only upon success, with no upfront cost”).
“How is Arzani different from Rightbiz or other marketplaces/brokers?” – This is a direct comparison question. The answer can summarize 2-3 key differentiators in a friendly way: Traditional marketplaces are essentially bulletin boards – they list businesses but don’t actively help you succeed. Arzani is different: we guide you end-to-end with AI analytics and expert support. Compared to Rightbiz or others, Arzani provides a free precise valuation, personalized buyer matching, and a faster sales process. We’re more than a listing site – we’re a smart platform to maximize your outcome. And unlike hiring a broker (who might charge 8-10% commission), Arzani lets you handle the sale with powerful tools at a fraction of the cost. This kind of answer positions Arzani as a modern, value-rich alternative without directly bashing the competitor. It’s factual and benefit-oriented, which is persuasive.
“How long does it take to sell a business on Arzani?” – Many will wonder about timeline. Answer: It varies by business, but Arzani’s data shows well-priced listings with complete info often attract offers within weeks. On average, Arzani listings close in 2-6 months, which is considerably faster than the 6-12+ month industry average​
arzani.co.uk
. Our AI helps optimize your pricing and listing details to speed up the process while maintaining value. This both sets realistic expectations and uses Arzani’s advantage of being faster​
arzani.co.uk
 as a selling point.
“Is Arzani suitable for [my type/size of business]?” – If the marketplace has a niche (SMBs), someone might ask if their business is too small, too large, or not the right industry. Answer: Arzani is designed for small to medium-sized businesses across a wide range of industries – from local retail shops to online startups. Whether your business is valued at £50k or £5M, our platform scales to support you. We categorize listings by industry and size, and our buyer network is diverse. If you’re ever unsure, our team can advise on the best approach for your specific business. In short, if you’re an SMB in the UK, Arzani is built for you. (If there are exclusions, note them, but presumably Arzani focuses on SMB which covers a lot.)
“What happens after I get my free valuation?” – Explain the user journey to relieve uncertainty: After your valuation, you’ll receive a detailed report via email. You’ll also have the option to speak with an Arzani advisor (free consultation) to discuss the valuation and next steps. If you’re ready to proceed, you can create a listing on our marketplace (our system will carry over your data to make it easy). If not, no problem – the valuation is yours to keep, and you can come back whenever you’re ready. There’s no pressure or automatic listing. This sets expectations and invites them to engage further without fear.
Prioritize Top Questions: You don’t need to include every one of these, but definitely cover the biggies: cost, trust/accuracy, confidentiality, and what the process looks like. 4-6 well-chosen Q&As are usually sufficient. From a CRO standpoint, it’s better to explicitly answer these than to leave them guessing, because unanswered questions = friction. ConversionXL’s Peep Laja often emphasizes that addressing anxiety and information gaps is crucial to conversion – an FAQ is a great tool for that.
Tone in Answers: The answers should be reassuring, straightforward, and confidence-inspiring. If possible, anchor your answers in evidence or specifics (as shown above: citing accuracy percentages, mentioning GDPR compliance, etc. lends credibility). Avoid vague reassurances like “Don’t worry, it’s all good” – instead, give concrete reasons not to worry. Also, keep answers concise; if something requires a long explanation, you might consider if that content should be baked earlier on the page or if it’s a sign the concept needs simplifying. For a landing page, each answer might be 2-4 sentences long (some of the examples above are a bit lengthy; they could be trimmed for brevity).
Design Consideration: As mentioned, FAQs can be accordion-style to save space (click to expand answers). This can make the page appear shorter and allows users to pick the questions they care about. However, if you have room, showing the questions and answers outright can be beneficial for scanning – a user might not bother clicking if they’re only mildly curious, and then miss an answer that would have convinced them. A compromise approach is to show a short list of Q’s, and clicking slides down the page to an answer or pops it out. If using accordions, ensure the UI is obvious and mobile-friendly (larger tap targets).
After reading the Objection Handling/FAQ, a prospect should feel that nothing critical has been left unanswered. They should sense transparency and thoroughness – important trust factors. With objections out of the way, all that’s left is to strongly prompt them to take action.
Final CTA Section
What it is: The final CTA section is the concluding part of the landing page, typically where you present one more compelling call-to-action for the visitor to convert (in this case, to get their free valuation). It often includes a short summary or tagline reinforcing the offer, plus the CTA button or form. Think of it as the “last pitch” and invitation. Objectives: Provide a clear, irresistible last push to get the user to take the next step now. Summarize or re-emphasize the core value briefly, maybe add a small incentive or urgency, and make it extremely easy to act (with a big CTA). By the end of this section, ideally the visitor clicks the button or begins filling the form – conversion accomplished. Best Practices & Content:
Concise Value Reiteration: Include a short sentence or two that encapsulates the key benefit of converting. For example: “Ready to see what your business could be worth? Don’t leave money on the table – get a precise, AI-powered valuation in minutes.” This reminds them of why they should care about this CTA (the benefit: knowing their value, not missing out on money). Another approach: “Take the first step toward a successful business sale with a FREE valuation from Arzani.” Use strong, positive language that aligns with their goal (successful sale, confident decision, growth, etc.). If possible, tie in an emotional angle: “Gain clarity and confidence for your next move.”
CTA Button (and/or form): Present the primary CTA again, prominently. If you only had a button in the hero, you might actually include a short form here to reduce a step (e.g., Name + Email + “Get My Free Valuation” button). Or vice versa – if you had a form on top, you could simply do a large button here that scrolls back up to the form or triggers a popup. The Balsamiq guide suggests repeating the same call to action at the bottom paired with a closing headline​
balsamiq.com
, which is exactly what we’re doing. The button text should be the same action phrase as before for consistency (e.g., “Get My Free Valuation”). Maintain the same color and style as earlier CTAs so it’s recognized as the same action. Ensure it’s large enough to tap on mobile and surrounded by whitespace. If you choose to embed a form here, make it as short as possible (perhaps even just an email address field with a “Get Started” button, then you can collect more info in the next step or follow-up).
Secondary Reinforcement Elements: Next to the CTA or under it, you can add very brief trust boosters:
A small lock icon with “Your information is private and secure.” (This reassures as they’re about to submit info).
Or a note like “No credit card required, no obligations” to reduce perceived commitment.
If you have a high count of people who have taken the action, something like “Join 200+ business owners who have discovered their valuation with Arzani.” This creates FOMO/consensus gently.
Keep these secondary texts small so they don’t distract, but visible enough to be noticed subconsciously.
Urgency or Scarcity (if ethical): If there is any time-bound aspect to the offer, mention it. For example, if the free valuation is a limited-time promotion (assuming it is or could be), say “(Limited time offer – free valuations available through [Month]!)” near the CTA. This can nudge procrastinators. If not time-limited, you can still instill urgency by context: “Market conditions are always changing – get your up-to-date valuation now.” This implies do it sooner rather than later because maybe the value could shift. However, maintain honesty; do not fabricate urgency if it’s not real. Alternatively, you could say something like “Get started today and be ahead of 90% of sellers who wait too long.” But simpler is better: maybe a subtle “now” or “today” in the CTA line is enough (e.g., “Get your free valuation now” suggests urgency without a hard deadline).
Wrap-up Tone: The tone should be encouraging and positive. You want to leave them feeling empowered: “You’ve seen how Arzani can transform the way you buy or sell a business. The next step is easy and free – claim your valuation and let data guide your decisions.” Keep it short though; at this point, you don’t want to introduce new info, just motivate action on what’s already been said.
Avoid introducing new links or distractions: At the bottom, aside from perhaps a privacy policy link (in small text), do not add extra buttons like “Learn more” or anything that could take them away. The only thing to click should be the CTA or maybe FAQ toggles if those exist near. One CTA, one focus​
balsamiq.com
. If you have a site footer with other nav links, consider omitting it or keeping it minimal (just terms/privacy). A landing page can have an extremely minimal footer to avoid off-ramps.
Mobile considerations: Often on mobile, after scrolling through content, a user may need to scroll back up to find the CTA. That’s why repeating it at bottom is vital – it catches those who made it through the content. Also, some designs implement a sticky footer bar on mobile with the CTA (“Free Valuation”) always visible. That’s an advanced technique that can boost conversion by removing the need to scroll to find the CTA. If you have dev capacity to implement that, it’s worth testing (just ensure it’s not too intrusive). Otherwise, the bottom CTA does the job when they reach the end.
Example Final Section: Imagine the bottom of the page looking like this:
Ready to Maximize Your Business’s Value?
Don’t leave the future of your business to guesswork. Take advantage of Arzani’s free AI-driven valuation and expert insights today to plan your next move with confidence.
【CTA Button: Get My Free Valuation】
It’s fast, free, and 100% confidential.
This setup gives a final rallying cry (maximize your value, don’t rely on guesswork), a reiteration of the free offer, and a trust line about being confidential. The CTA button is right there to tap. Once the user clicks this CTA, they either submit the form or go to a dedicated sign-up/valuation page. Make sure that subsequent step is also optimized – e.g., a short form, a clear next step indicator, and a thank-you/confirmation with what happens next (if beyond the scope of this page, at least plan for it). In summary, the final CTA section should leave no ambiguity about what the user should do. It caps off the persuasive journey with a clear invitation. At this point, we’ve guided the user through understanding why they need this, how Arzani helps, built trust, answered questions, and given every incentive to act. All that’s left is their click.
With the section-by-section breakdown covered, you have a blueprint for content. But crafting the copy and layout is just part of the equation. Next, we’ll discuss some copywriting frameworks that underpin this structure, as well as design and UX principles (visual hierarchy, mobile design, etc.) to ensure the page not only reads well but also looks and functions optimally for conversion.
Copywriting Frameworks and Formulas
Creating persuasive landing page copy is made easier by leveraging proven copywriting frameworks. These frameworks are formulas or structures that tap into how people process information and make decisions. For Arzani’s landing page, using these will ensure our messaging is coherent, compelling, and conversion-focused. Here are key frameworks and how they apply:
AIDA (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action): This classic formula maps perfectly to a landing page structure​
unbounce.com
​
unbounce.com
.
Attention: The hero section’s headline and imagery grab attention (e.g., bold statement about AI valuations).
Interest: The problem/agitation section and the start of the solution section build interest by talking about issues the audience cares about and hinting at solutions. We maintain interest with subheads and engaging copy (like storytelling about a seller’s journey).
Desire: The solution/benefits, features, and social proof sections cultivate desire. We show the outcomes and advantages (fast sales, accurate pricing, etc.) and have testimonials that make the prospect want those results for themselves. This is where we translate product features into personal benefits that the prospect desires (more money, less stress, confidence).
Action: Finally, the CTA sections (both top and bottom) prompt action, with clear instructions to “Get a free valuation.” The action is backed by all the previous steps making sense and appealing. In practice, we’ve structured the page in an AIDA-like flow (with some elements like FAQs inserted to reinforce Desire and nudge Action by removing doubt). AIDA is effective because it mirrors the natural psychological progression of a buyer.
PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solution): We used this heavily in the content. It’s one of Joanna Wiebe’s favored formulas for landing pages and emails because it immediately resonates with the audience’s pain before offering a fix.
Problem: We explicitly call out the problems (e.g., “Unsure of your business’s value?” or “Selling a business is complicated and slow.”).
Agitate: We then amplify that by describing consequences or frustrations (e.g., “You could be undervaluing by thousands, or waiting forever for the right buyer…”).
Solution: We introduce Arzani as the solution, showing how it addresses each aspect of the problem (AI valuations to remove guesswork, marketplace to find buyers, etc.). We structured the landing page with a problem/agitation section followed by the solution section, which is essentially applying PAS. This formula is great for hooking readers because it shows empathy (you get their problem) and then provides relief (your solution). It’s more emotionally driven than AIDA’s initial stages, which is often perfect for B2B leads who may be feeling pain points acutely (like an owner anxious about selling). Tip: When writing in PAS, really use the language the customer uses when thinking about their problem. For example, an owner might say “I don’t even know where to start to sell my business.” We might put that phrasing in the copy or headline to reflect their inner dialogue (this is conversion copywriting 101 – echoing the “voice of the customer”). As Unbounce’s test showed, sometimes even a slightly clever or informal tone that matches the customer’s voice can outperform a bland but clear one​
unbounce.com
. E.g., a headline like “Selling your business sucks… we’re here to change that” could grab attention by speaking plainly. We’d test such tone, but it’s an example of matching their feelings (if appropriate for the professional tone we want).
The 4 Ps (Promise, Picture, Proof, Push): This is another formula (often used in sales letters) which we implicitly cover:
Promise: The headline/subheadline make a promise (e.g., free valuation, faster sale).
Picture: The copy then paints a picture of life with the solution (business sold easily, etc.).
Proof: Social proof and data give proof that the promise is real (testimonials, stats).
Push: The final CTA and urgency push them to act now. We’ve integrated these elements throughout. For instance, promise in hero, proof in testimonials, push in final CTA.
FAB (Features-Advantages-Benefits): When writing about features (like we did in the feature/benefit section), a good micro-framework is to go from Feature -> Advantage -> Benefit. For example: Feature: “AI valuation algorithm” -> Advantage: “processes 100+ data points in seconds” -> Benefit: “you get an accurate valuation instantly, without tedious calculations or waiting.” In the copy we provided, we often merged advantage and benefit by saying what it does and why that’s good. Keeping FAB in mind ensures that for every feature (AI, matching, etc.), we explicitly state the benefit (so what?). This prevents the content from becoming too product-centric and keeps it customer-centric. If you find any piece of copy that is just describing a tool or feature, ask “So what for the user?” and add that. For example, “Real-time market data feed” (feature) – so what? – “so you always have the latest info on buyer demand and can time your sale optimally” (benefit).
Storytelling & Narrative Arc: As referenced in the Leadfeeder guide​
leadfeeder.com
, telling a story can be incredibly effective. We didn’t write a full case study narrative in our example (other than perhaps in a testimonial or scenario), but we could weave a simple narrative: The before state (struggling seller), the after state (successful sale via Arzani), and Arzani as the bridge between them. This is sometimes called Before-After-Bridge: Before (describe the customer’s world before, with pain) -> After (imagine how great it is after the problem is solved) -> Bridge (present your solution as the way to get from before to after). For instance, “Before Arzani: you’re overwhelmed and unsure. After Arzani: you’ve sold your business smoothly for a great price. Bridge: Arzani’s AI and team guide you every step of the way.” We implicitly used this concept: painting the painful before, then the improved after with Arzani. It’s a powerful persuasive structure because it helps the prospect visualize success.
Clarity over Cleverness (with a caveat): A commonly cited rule (Oli Gardner, Peep Laja, etc.) is “Clarity trumps cleverness” in conversion copy​
unbounce.com
. We should adhere to clarity – especially since this is a professional B2B context, we don’t want to confuse with cutesy slogans that don’t communicate value. That said, as the Unbounce test showed, if a clever phrase actually resonates better with the audience’s internal monologue, it can win​
unbounce.com
. For example, something like “The smartest way to sell your business” vs. a more playful “Finally, a way to sell your business that doesn’t drive you crazy.” The latter is a bit more informal but might connect emotionally. We can incorporate mild cleverness or a human touch as long as the core message remains clear. The key is testing (as they did with clear vs clever and found clever won in that case because it felt more relatable​
unbounce.com
). In practice, start with a clear baseline and consider testing more personality if appropriate.
Use of Second Person (“You”) and Command Verbs: Good conversion copy speaks directly to the reader. We predominantly use “you” (and “your”) in the copy, which makes it feel like we’re addressing their personal situation, rather than talking abstractly. E.g., “Get your free valuation” (instead of “Get a free valuation for businesses”). Also, using command verbs in CTA (“Get”, “Discover”, “Start”) creates a sense of immediacy and agency. We avoid passive or weak language around the CTA. Instead of “You can request a free valuation” (too passive), we say “Get your free valuation” (active and direct).
Keep Paragraphs and Sentences Digestible: We aim for a conversational yet authoritative tone. That often means varying sentence length but generally keeping them on the shorter side for easy consumption. We broke content into short paragraphs (as we should in final formatting, 2-4 sentences ideally each) to avoid walls of text. In the outline above, we provided a lot of content, but in the actual page design, it will be chunked under headings, bullets, etc., so it won’t feel like reading an essay. The content should flow logically – each section heading gives context to the text that follows, making it easy for someone skimming to still get the gist.
Address the Reader’s Stage of Awareness: A concept from copywriting expert Eugene Schwartz is the spectrum of customer awareness. Some readers might be completely unaware (they don’t even know they have a problem), some are problem-aware, some solution-aware, some product-aware. Given someone who lands on Arzani’s page likely clicked an ad or search result about “sell my business” or “business valuation,” they are at least problem-aware (they know they want to sell or need a valuation) and possibly solution-aware (they may know solutions exist like brokers or marketplaces). We craft the copy accordingly:
We don’t have to convince them that selling a business can be beneficial (they’re already looking into it), but we do need to convince them that Arzani’s way is the best solution (so they might not be product-aware about Arzani specifically).
Thus, we focus on differentiators and benefits of our solution over the status quo. If someone is more unaware, the problem-agitation parts educate them on why they need a solution in the first place (covering that base too).
The frameworks PAS and AIDA inherently handle awareness by starting with problem (for those not even sure of solution yet) and then moving to solution.
Use of Power Words and Persuasive Language: Certain words carry persuasive weight – like “free”, “proven”, “exclusive”, “guaranteed”, “instantly”, “secure”, etc. We have already used some (“free valuation”, “advanced analytics”, “comprehensive”, “streamlined”, “trusted by”, “ensure”, etc.). In B2B, words that convey safety, speed, ease, and value are particularly effective. But avoid hype or overuse of superlatives (don’t say “the best thing ever!” – say it in a way that can be believed, e.g., “designed to be faster and smarter than traditional methods” – it’s a claim but backed by reason). Also avoid vague buzzwords; instead of “revolutionary synergy platform”, be concrete (“AI-powered business marketplace” is understandable).
Make the Offer Clear: The primary offer here is “Free valuation”. We should ensure this stands out. It’s mentioned in headline, CTA, etc. Another formula – not exactly a copy framework but a principle – is "value proposition = headline + subhead + 3 bullets." We effectively did that in the hero. The idea is that someone should grasp the offer and value prop in about 5 seconds (which is what the above structure provides). Copyhackers stresses that the benefit of the offer must be clear​
copyhackers.com
. On our page, the benefit of clicking (getting a free valuation => clarity on your business’s worth + step toward selling at max value) is emphasized. We can even label the CTA as “Get My Free Valuation Report” if we want to highlight they’ll get a deliverable (the word “report” might increase perceived value of what they receive).
Joanna Wiebe’s Technique – “So what? Prove it.”: A trick from Copyhackers is to go through your copy and for each claim, ask “So what?” (to ensure you’ve given a benefit) and “Can I prove it?” (to ensure credibility). We have been doing that by adding stats from Arzani and testimonials. For example, we say “sell 37% faster” – that’s a proof element with a number. When we say “maximize your sale price,” we back it with “accurate market analysis helps you get the highest possible price” and perhaps a stat or testimonial confirming that. This combination of benefit + proof is persuasive. Peep Laja often emphasizes the need for credible specifics: general platitudes don’t convert as well as concrete claims and evidence.
Cialdini’s Persuasion Principles in Copy: We naturally incorporated some:
Reciprocity: We’re giving a free valuation – this is like a gift which can invoke a sense of reciprocity (they may feel more inclined to engage or list with us after receiving value for free).
Social Proof: We dedicated a section to testimonials and logos – clearly leveraging this principle.
Authority: Citing that Arzani uses advanced AI, has experts, possibly mentioning partnerships or compliance, all build authority. Even the polished design and copy will lend authority.
Scarcity: If we can truthfully add a scarcity element (limited time free, limited spots), that could boost action. If not, we use soft urgency as discussed.
Consistency/Commitment: By getting them to take a small action (free valuation) they begin a journey that might lead to listing. This micro-commitment can make them more likely to follow through (consistency principle – once they identify as someone interested in selling, they’ll act in line with that identity).
Liking: We try to make the tone personable and empathetic, so they feel Arzani understands them. If Arzani has a founder story or mission about “helping small business owners succeed”, sometimes including a human element like that can increase liking (people prefer to do business with those they like or feel share their values). Even just using testimonials from relatable business owners fosters liking.
Templates and Swipes: The structure we created can be seen as a template. To implement immediately, one could fill in each section with the specifics of Arzani. We gave a lot of those specifics as examples drawn from Arzani’s site (AI, etc.). A helpful tip is to swipe messaging from competitors where they do well. For instance, Rightbiz highlights “Maximised Business Value”, “Dynamic Marketing Exposure”, etc.​
rightbiz.co.uk
 – Arzani can use similar points but amp them up (with AI angle). We basically did that in features. Using competitor messaging as a starting point (not copying, but as inspiration) ensures you cover what the market expects plus differentiate. Another template is to use headline formulas like:
“How to [achieve desired outcome] without [pain].” E.g., “How to sell your business fast without paying hefty commissions.” That could be a subheader or ad copy leading to the page.
“Get [Benefit] in [Short Time] – [CTA].” E.g., “Get an accurate business valuation in 5 minutes – free.” Short and enticing.
We can craft multiple versions and test (A/B test headlines or subheads).
Consistent Messaging and Formula Throughline: We should ensure that the tone and promises made in any ads that lead here align with the landing page (for message match). If the ad says “Free Business Valuation in 24 hours,” the landing page should mention that timeframe or at least not contradict it. Also, maintain consistency in terms of the framework – if an ad already agitated a problem, the landing can continue from that. If the traffic is coming cold, the landing might have to do more of the problem setup itself.
In summary, by applying AIDA to structure the page, PAS to hook the audience, and sprinkling in techniques like FAB and social proof, we create a narrative that is both logical and emotionally compelling. Every piece of copy has a job – whether to grab attention, build interest, stoke desire, or prompt action. Using these frameworks ensures no piece is wasted and the reader is guided step by step toward converting. Finally, good copywriting goes hand-in-hand with good design. So next, let’s cover the visual and design principles (visual hierarchy, layout, mobile optimization, etc.) that will elevate this copy and make the page as user-friendly and conversion-friendly as possible.
Visual Hierarchy and Design Principles
Great copy is only effective if it’s presented in a clear, visually appealing way. Visual hierarchy is about guiding the user’s eyes to the most important elements first, and ensuring the page is not overwhelming. We want Arzani’s landing page to look modern, professional, and easy to digest at a glance. Below are key design principles and how to implement them:
Clear Hierarchy of Text: Establish a distinct difference between headlines, subheadings, body text, and buttons. The main headline (H1) should
Visual Hierarchy and Design Principles
A well-designed landing page uses visual hierarchy to guide visitors to key information in the right order. Visual hierarchy means making the most important elements the most prominent (via size, color, placement), so the page communicates clearly even to someone skimming. Here’s how to apply core design principles for Arzani’s page:
Hierarchy of Text and Elements: Establish a clear typographic hierarchy. The main headline should be the largest text on the page – it immediately draws the ey​
balsamiq.com
】. Subheadings (like section titles “The Solution” or “Why Arzani”) should be smaller than the main headline but larger than body text. Use consistent fonts (e.g., a clean sans-serif for a modern look) and brand colors. Important messages (like the CTA text “Get a free valuation”) can be accented with a bold color or button. Supporting text should be smaller and secondary. By sizing and styling text in tiers, you ensure a visitor’s eye catches the headline first, then subheader, then body copy in order of importance.
Whitespace and Clean Layout: Don’t fear empty space – whitespace is your friend. Crowding elements makes a page feel overwhelming. Adequate spacing around sections and around the CTA button makes each component stand ou​
balsamiq.com
】. For example, ensure there’s padding between the hero text and the next section, and clear separation between distinct sections (problem, solution, etc.). Whitespace guides the eye by isolating groups of content. As Balsamiq’s example showed, adding space around elements can instantly remove a feeling of clutter and make the CTA more visually prominen​
balsamiq.com
】. Aim for a clean, uncluttered layout where each section (hero, benefits, proof, etc.) is visually distinct, perhaps by alternating background colors or using divider lines. A common practice is to use a subtle background color change or graphic element to signal a new section – e.g., hero on white, then a light grey background for the problem section, white again for solution, etc. This creates a rhythm and helps users instinctively know when they’ve moved to a new topi​
balsamiq.com
】.
F-Pattern and Flow: Users often scan in an “F” or “Z” pattern on desktop – meaning they look across the top, then down a bit, then across, and so on. Ensure your top horizontal (the hero) has the crucial info (which we do: headline, CTA). As they scroll, align important headings to the left (since eyes scan down the left side). We’ve structured content with clear left-aligned headings and short paragraphs/bullets, which fits these reading patterns. On mobile, users scroll down in a linear fashion, so center-align key elements and use short blocks of text. In general, break up text with visuals or bullets so the page isn’t just a wall of text. Our design includes many bullets and short paragraphs, making it easy to scan.
Contrast and Color Use: Use color contrast to highlight the CTA and key points. Arzani’s brand colors (perhaps blues or other corporate tones) can be used for headlines or accents, but choose one high-contrast color for the CTA buttons (for instance, if the site is mostly blue/grey, maybe the CTA is an orange or green – something that pops). The CTA button should stand out against the background and other element​
balsamiq.com
】. Also ensure text contrast is high – dark text on a light background (or vice versa) so it’s very readable (accessibility is important, e.g., meet WCAG contrast ratios). Use color sparingly for emphasis: perhaps one accent color for all buttons and highlights, while keeping the rest of the palette neutral or brand-aligned. Too many colors can be visually confusing; consistency here builds recognition (e.g., if all CTA buttons are Arzani green, users learn that color = actionable).
Directional Cues: Subtle visual cues can direct attention. For example, an arrow icon or downward chevron at the end of the hero could signal “scroll for more”, guiding users to continu​
balsamiq.com
】. If you use an image of a person in the hero, you can have them looking toward the CTA/button – studies show people follow line of sight, so this can nudge visitors to look at the form or button. In the design, if we include illustrations, we might angle them or use shapes that lead the eye toward the content (e.g., a diagonal background line pointing toward the headline). Balsamiq’s own landing page uses a subtle downward arrow shape in design to encourage scrollin​
balsamiq.com
】. We can mimic such techniques: for instance, a slight diagonal background that “points” to the next section or a contrast band that draws the eye down.
Images and Graphics with Purpose: Every image on the page should support the message (not just decorate). For instance, use icons in the benefits section to reinforce each point (a shield icon for security, a clock for faster sales, etc.), which helps visual learners grasp the meaning quickly. If using photos (like for testimonials), ensure they are high quality and professional. Avoid generic stock photos; if you need a generic image (say for the hero background), choose something subtle and relevant (like an abstract image of data, or an office scene that isn’t cheesy). Keep imagery consistent in style and tone. If Arzani uses illustrations on the website, carry that style here for brand consistency. Also, be mindful of image file sizes – compress images for web so the page loads fast (speed is part of UX). A fast-loading page keeps users from bouncing; Google’s data shows even a 1-2 second delay can hurt conversions.
No Visual Clutter: Resist the temptation to overdesign. One primary image or graphic per section is usually enough. For example, in the hero maybe one illustration, in the solution section maybe an accompanying image of the dashboard, etc. Lots of competing visuals can distract from the CTA. Maintain a consistent alignment and grid. Use bullet lists or icons to chunk information instead of long paragraphs – it’s visually cleaner and aligns content in a nice block. The design should communicate “professional and trustworthy”. That means clean lines, enough padding, and consistency (same font styles for similar elements, same button styles throughout). Consistency is a subtle but important part of visual hierarchy – if every section looked wildly different, the user might not realize they are parts of one story. We want each part distinct yet cohesive with the overall design language.
Responsive Layout (Grid System): Design using a responsive grid (e.g., 12-column grid for desktop that collapses to fewer columns on mobile). On desktop, you might have two-column arrangements (text on left, image on right, etc.), but on mobile these will stack vertically. Plan for that: ensure that when stacking, the content still makes sense order-wise (usually you want text to come before the image it’s referring to, so the user sees the explanation before/above the image on a phone). Test the hierarchy on both desktop and mobile. The most important info should ideally appear early on mobile too (so maybe you repeat the CTA or have a shorter summary high up on mobile if needed).
Highlighting Key Data or Quotes: If there’s a particularly compelling stat or testimonial snippet, consider using typographic emphasis to make it stand out. For example, a big quotation mark graphic and a few words in larger font to pull out a phrase like “sold in 3 months above asking price” from a testimonial can catch attention. Similarly, if you have a key stat (“37% faster sales”), you could display that in a large font as a visual element on its own. These act as focal points in the visual hierarchy and break up text-heavy sections. Just don’t overdo it – pick one or two such highlights.
Above-the-Fold Considerations: The area immediately visible (above the fold) on page load should contain the most crucial elements: headline, subhead, CTA, possibly a hero image, and maybe a very brief trust indicator (like “[★ ★ ★ ★ ★] Trusted by 500+ UK businesses” or a couple of client logos) to build instant credibility. We want a first-time visitor to get the value prop without any scrollin​
copyhackers.com
​
copyhackers.com
】. That said, don’t cram too much just for the sake of “the fold” – it’s okay if details are below, as long as the essential hook is visible. Modern users know to scroll, especially if the design makes it clear more content is below (hence an arrow or a cut-off part of an image can hint at more below).
Consistency with Brand and Professional Aesthetics: Because Arzani is a B2B platform dealing with financial transactions, the design should err on the side of professional, modern minimalism rather than overly playful or artistic. Use Arzani’s branding guidelines (colors, logo, typography) for trust and consistency. If Arzani has a logo and style from its main site, reflect that here (the landing page can omit navigation, but it should still look like it’s Arzani’s property). Elements like the footer (if any) should use the same style as the main site’s footer (but trimmed down as discussed). This consistency builds trust – visitors feel it’s a credible company’s page, not a random ad page.
Accessibility and Readability: Use at least medium-sized fonts (e.g., 16px+ for body text) to ensure readability on all screens. High contrast for text as mentioned. Also consider accessibility in design: use real text (not text in images) for everything important (so screen readers can read it). Add alt text to images (especially if, say, the hero image contains some information). Ensure the page can be navigated with keyboard (e.g., the form fields highlight clearly when tabbed). These may seem technical, but accessibility overlaps with good UX which overlaps with conversion – an accessible page is often a more user-friendly page for everyone.
Visual Emphasis on CTA: Since conversion is the goal, visually emphasize the CTA sections. For instance, the final CTA section might have a slightly different background or a prominent encapsulating design (like a colored box or a standout banner) to draw the ey​
balsamiq.com
】. Encapsulation is a known technique: putting the CTA in a box or distinct panel can increase its visibility. You can also include a subtle shadow or glow on the CTA button to make it “pop” off the page (while still looking clean). Ensure there’s nothing competing with that button (no other buttons of equal weight). Unbounce’s principle of “Attention-Driven Design” is relevant: for each page, ask if any element is drawing attention away from the main conversion goal; if yes, consider removing or downplaying it. We’ve already minimized distractions by removing nav, etc., but design-wise, keep secondary links (like privacy or FAQ toggles) visually small relative to the big orange (for example) CTA button.
In essence, the page design should lead a visitor through a visual story: a bold headline grabs them, informative sections flow one to the next, proof is clearly distinguished, and the call-to-action shines through. By using size, color, and spacing intelligently, we ensure the page isn’t just pretty – it’s purposeful. Each design element either increases understanding or drives action (or both). This synergy of design and copy will make the landing page far more effective.
Mobile-First and Responsive Design Best Practices
Given the prevalence of mobile users, Arzani’s landing page must be mobile-first and fully responsive. In fact, designing mobile-first (starting with the small screen in mind) often leads to a cleaner, more focused layout that benefits all devices. Here’s how to ensure a stellar mobile experience:
Mobile-First Approach: Begin by conceptualizing the page on a smartphone screen. Prioritize content so that only the most crucial elements appear first on mobile. This often forces beneficial simplification: shorter headlines, tighter copy, essential images only. Once the mobile layout is solid, you can enhance it for larger screens (adding columns or images side-by-side for desktop, for example). This approach ensures the page works great on mobile, rather than being a shrunk-down afterthought. As of 2025, Google indexes and ranks pages based on the mobile version primarily (mobile-first indexing​
leadfeeder.com
】, so a mobile-optimized page is not only good for users but for SEO too.
Responsive Layout and Breakpoints: Use responsive design techniques (CSS flexbox/grid, media queries) so the page adapts to various screen sizes: mobile, tablet, desktop, large monitors. Typically:
On mobile (small screens): Use a single-column layout. Everything should stack vertically. Images should scale to full width (with appropriate aspect ratio) so they’re not cut off or too small to see. Text blocks should have margins/padding so they don’t touch the screen edges (to avoid a cramped look and to prevent accidental edge taps).
On desktop (wider screens): You can utilize multi-column sections (e.g., text beside image) since there’s space. But also be mindful of very large screens – don’t stretch paragraphs too wide (long lines of text are hard to read). A max width container (like 1200px or so) centered on wide screens can keep readability high. That way, on a huge monitor, the content doesn’t become an 800px-long line; it stays in a nice contained width.
Navigation and Menus on Mobile: We’ve removed main navigation for conversion reason​
copyhackers.com
】. If any menu is present (say, a hamburger with minimal links like “Login” for existing users), ensure it’s accessible and doesn’t cover the CTA when opened. But ideally, we avoid any extra nav on this landing page to keep focus. So menu should be minimal or none. If the landing page is within a larger site with a fixed header normally, consider disabling that header for this page or using a simpler top bar (like just the logo and maybe a help icon).
Ensure Fast Load Times: Mobile users can have slower connections, so optimize performance:
Compress images (use modern formats like WebP/AVIF when possible; ensure images are appropriately sized – no 2000px wide image when it’s displayed at 400px on mobile).
Minimize heavy scripts. If using a video, use a lightweight thumbnail or ensure it’s not auto-playing on mobile (auto-playing video/audio can also annoy users and is data-heavy).
Use browser caching and possibly a CDN for assets. Fast load is crucial – as mentioned, a slow page frustrates users (leading to bounces) and hurts Google ranking​
leadfeeder.com
】. Tools like Google PageSpeed Insights or Lighthouse can be used to check mobile performance. Aim for green scores where possible.
Touchable Elements: Make sure all interactive elements are easy to tap with a finger:
Buttons should be sufficiently large (a minimum of ~44px height according to Apple’s guidelines, for example). The CTA buttons we have are likely large and centered, which is good.
Form fields must also be tappable and not too close to other links (to prevent mis-taps). Provide enough space between form input fields.
Use the correct input types on mobile – e.g., <input type="email"> for email (shows the “@” on the mobile keyboard), <input type="tel"> for phone (shows numeric keypad). This little UX detail reduces friction in form input on mobile.
If any links are present (like FAQ questions could be expandable), ensure they are big enough to tap and spaced apart.
Sticky CTAs on Mobile: Consider a sticky footer or header CTA on mobile. For instance, a small bar at the bottom of the screen with “Get your free valuation” that’s always visible as they scroll. This way, after scrolling through info, the user doesn’t have to scroll back up to click the CTA. They can tap the sticky bar which would jump to the form or trigger it. Many mobile-optimized landers use this to good effect (just ensure it’s not too large to become annoying, and that it doesn’t overlap important content). We should test this, but it’s a powerful tactic to increase conversions on mobile where scrolling is extensiv​
balsamiq.com
】. If implementing, keep it minimal: maybe just the text and an icon or button style, and use Arzani’s accent color to make it visible.
No Intrusive Pop-ups: On mobile especially, avoid any pop-up or interstitial that covers content (e.g., “Subscribe to newsletter” modals, etc.). Not only do these hurt UX, but Google penalizes mobile pages that show intrusive interstitials. Our landing page likely won’t have any by design, since the goal is conversion (perhaps a thank-you modal after conversion, which is fine). If you ever consider using exit-intent popups or such, note that on mobile exit-intent is tricky and often translates to something intrusive. It’s generally safer to avoid them.
Optimize Font and Button Sizes: As mentioned, make sure text is large enough on mobile. Also consider line-height (spacing between lines) – slightly larger line-height (say 1.5em) improves readability of paragraphs on small screens. Buttons and form inputs should use a legible font size too. Often a problem on mobile is some desktop styles make text tiny on mobile; to counteract that, using relative fonts (like using viewport width units or percentages) can help scale text appropriately. We want to avoid the need for the user to zoom in.
Testing on Real Devices: It’s vital to test the landing page on actual phones and tablets. Emulators in a browser are a start, but real devices can reveal issues (like an element that is off-screen or a fixed element that doesn’t behave correctly). Check both iOS and Android if possible, and multiple browsers (Chrome, Safari). Also test various screen sizes – e.g., older smaller phones vs newer big phones – to ensure the design adapts (the responsive breakpoints might need tweaking if something looks off at a certain size).
Mobile-Specific Adjustments: Sometimes you might hide or swap out certain elements on mobile to streamline the experience. For example, a large image that looks great on desktop might be too small to be useful on mobile or push important text too far down. You could choose to hide that image on mobile for a better flow, or use a simpler image. Ensure headings don’t occupy too many lines on a narrow screen – if a headline is long, you might use a slightly smaller font on mobile or shorten the copy for mobile via CSS (advanced, but sometimes done). The key is the core message remains the same and nothing essential is lost for mobile users. Everything we planned (headline, benefits, CTA, proof) should still be present on mobile, just arranged vertically.
Touch Gestures and Mobile Behavior: If using any carousels (like for testimonials or images), ensure they support swipe gestures on mobile – users should be able to swipe left/right to navigate, not just rely on tiny arrow buttons. Also consider disabling any hover effects for mobile (since hover doesn’t exist on touch screens) and making sure clickable areas are obvious (maybe add subtle underlines on text links on mobile if color alone might not indicate it’s a link). Basically, test that any interactive element works with taps/swipes.
By following these mobile-first best practices, the landing page will provide a smooth experience on small screens. Remember, many busy entrepreneurs might click an ad or email on their phone first. If the mobile experience is poor, they’ll drop off and we lose the lead. But if it’s seamless – fast, easy to read, easy to act – we capture their interest on the spot. Additionally, a great mobile page bolsters our SEO (as Google prioritizes mobile-friendly sites). Arzani will benefit from making a strong impression on mobile users, which in turn boosts overall conversion rates.
CTA Optimization Techniques
The Call to Action (CTA) is the conversion keystone of the landing page. We need to make it as compelling and frictionless as possible for visitors to click that “Get a free valuation” button. We’ve touched on CTA copy and design; here we’ll summarize and add techniques specifically to optimize the CTA for maximum conversions:
Singular, Prominent CTA: As emphasized, stick to one primary CTA action on the page – Get a free valuation. While we repeat the button in multiple places (top and bottom), it always does the same thing (initiates the valuation process​

】. This consistency avoids confusion. Every CTA instance should be highly visible: use a bright, contrasting color that isn’t heavily used elsewhere on the page (to draw the eye). Also, make sure the CTA button looks like a button – use a rectangular shape with perhaps slightly rounded corners, and a hover effect on desktop (e.g., a slight darken or shadow on hover) to signal interactivit​
balsamiq.com
】. On mobile, as mentioned, consider a sticky CTA that’s always at hand.
CTA Copy – Clarity and Value: The wording on the CTA should combine an action verb with a value proposition. “Get My Free Valuation” is effective because it’s action-oriented (“Get”), personalized (“My”), and highlights the value (“Free Valuation”). Using first-person (“My”) in CTA copy is a known technique that can increase clicks because it subconsciously makes the user envision the result as theirs (e.g., Copyhackers found first-person CTAs often perform well). We could test variants like “Get Your Free Valuation” vs “Get My Free Valuation” – but starting with first-person is a good bet. Also ensure it’s not too wordy – 2-5 words is ideal for button text. It should convey what happens next; avoid generic “Submit” or “Continue”, which are weak. “Get Free Valuation” tells them exactly what they’re getting by clicking.
Visual Emphasis and Isolation: Surround the CTA with whitespace or an encapsulating design to make it stand ou​
balsamiq.com
】. For example, in the hero, if the CTA is below the subheadline, make sure there’s sufficient padding around it so it doesn’t get lost. In the final section, we might put the CTA on its own line with a minimal text around. This isolation effect draws attention. Also, use an arrow icon or chevron on the button if appropriate (like “→” or a right-pointing arrow graphic after the text) to give a visual cue of forward movement. It’s not necessary, but sometimes can subtly increase click rates (it indicates “this will take you somewhere”).
Size and Placement: The CTA buttons should be big enough to notice easily. A good rule is that the main CTA should be one of the largest elements on the screen after the headline. It shouldn’t be so large that it looks obnoxious, but it should be larger than any secondary buttons (if we had any, which we don’t) or form fields. Placement wise, we have one CTA early (likely right below hero text or integrated into hero) and one at the end. Additionally, a CTA can be repeated after a persuasive section – for instance, after the benefits or after social proof, we could include a text link or another button (“Ready to get your valuation? Click here”) leading to the form. Balsamiq suggests you may include the button multiple times if the page is long, at logical break​

】. For Arzani’s page, two times (top and bottom) is probably sufficient, given it’s not extremely long-form. But ensure the bottom CTA is immediately visible when a user finishes reading; they shouldn’t have to scroll back up to ac​
balsamiq.com
】.
Microcopy to Reduce Anxiety: Near the CTA, include a brief note that eases concerns. We did this with phrases like “fast, free, and 100% confidential” under the button. Other effective microcopy could be: “No credit card needed,” “No obligations,” or “Takes less than 2 minutes.” These address fears that clicking will lead to a tedious or costly process. For example, if someone worries “Will I have to fill a huge form?”, seeing “takes 2 minutes” sets their mind at ease. Or if they worry “Is this really free?”, the word “free” on the button and a reiteration below cover that. Another example: “We’ll provide your valuation with no strings attached.” This kind of microcopy builds trust right at the point of conversion.
Urgency and Timing Cues: To prompt immediate action, you can introduce urgency in the CTA or surrounding text (but carefully). For instance, the CTA could say “Get My Free Valuation Now”. Adding “now” or “today” can psychologically nudge faster action. If Arzani ever decides to make the free valuation a limited-time offer, that could be potent: e.g., “Get My Free Valuation (Limited Offer)” or a countdown indicating “Offer ends in 5 days” (though that would need a dynamic component or at least to be managed so it’s truthful). Even without a literal deadline, you can create a sense of urgency by emphasizing opportunity cost: “Get My Free Valuation and seize the market” – not typical on a button, but maybe in surrounding text like “Don’t miss out on this month’s active buyers – know your value now.” In our context, a gentle urgency (“now”) is likely enough, since pressing too hard might seem gimmicky in B2B. We can also rely on FOMO by hints like “Join dozens of business owners who’ve already valued their business this week” near the CTA if that data is available.
Testing CTA Variations: Optimize the CTA through A/B testing (more on that later) – but a quick note: test things like button color, copy text, and even shape. For example, perhaps a green button vs. an orange button could yield a better result – it often depends on what draws the eye given the rest of the color scheme. The good news is that because our page will have a singular focus, any color that isn’t used elsewhere will naturally stand out. Arzani’s brand palette might dictate the best choice (e.g., if their logo is blue, a complementary color like orange might stand out). Many studies show that contrasting color is more critical than any one “magic” color (there’s no universally best CTA color, it’s context-dependent). The key is consistency: pick a CTA color and use it for all primary buttons so users know that’s the action color.
Avoiding Distractions at CTA Click: Make sure that when the user clicks the CTA, the experience is smooth. If the CTA is a button that jumps to a form section, ensure it actually scrolls or opens correctly. If it opens a sign-up modal, the modal should load quickly and have the form ready. If it goes to another page, that page must be laser-focused too (ideally, we’d keep it on one page or a modal to not lose them). Essentially, the CTA’s effect should be immediate and on-point. Also, disable any unnecessary links near CTAs (for example, sometimes people put social media share buttons on landing pages – don’t do that, it tempts users to leave the page; we haven’t included any such things).
Use of Trust Badges Near CTA: Another optimization is placing a small trust symbol near the CTA. For example, a padlock icon with “Secure & confidential” (we mentioned), or a BBB accreditation logo if applicable, or even something like “★ 4.9/5 TrustScore” from reviews if Arzani had that. These can reassure right at the decision point. We just have to keep them subtle and in service of the CTA, not competing with it visually.
CTA in Email Follow-ups: Slightly tangential, but if someone leaves without converting, Arzani might retarget or email them (if we captured email via partial form). The landing page CTA optimization also extends to those follow-ups – e.g., email subject lines like “Don’t forget your free valuation” and in the email, a big CTA button to return. This is more about funnel strategy, but worth noting that the same principles (clear, compelling CTA) apply in any re-engagement.
In summary, our CTA strategy is: make it obvious, make it appealing, make it easy. “Obvious” through standout design and isolation, “appealing” through compelling copy (“free valuation” is inherently appealing to our audience) and urgency, and “easy” through minimizing steps and assuring them it’s simple/quick. By refining these aspects and continually testing improvements (CTA text and design are among the easiest high-impact tests to run), we can steadily boost the conversion rate of the page.
Social Proof and Credibility Elements
Trust is a deciding factor in converting B2B leads. We’ve already incorporated social proof in our content; here we’ll focus on how to maximize its impact through placement and variety of credibility elements:
Diverse Forms of Social Proof: We should include at least two or more types of social proof on the pag​
balsamiq.com
】:
Testimonials/Reviews: We have customer quotes which are extremely persuasive because they tell a story of success. Make sure these testimonials are attributed with name, perhaps business name or location, and a photo if possible. A face next to a quote adds authenticity. If a user sees “Sold my cafe in 4 months thanks to Arzani’s valuation – highly recommend!” – Jane D., Cafe Owner (London) with Jane’s smiling face, it humanizes our service and builds trust. Consider using a slider if space is tight, but also know that many users might not scroll a carousel – so it might be better to show 2-3 testimonials all at once in a column or grid. Each testimonial should hit a different angle if possible (one about fast sale, one about good price, one about ease of process) to cover multiple concerns.
Logos of Clients/Partners: If Arzani has notable businesses that have been bought/sold through the platform, show their logos in a “Trusted by” section. Even if the businesses aren’t widely famous, the presence of logos implies “real companies use this.” For example, logos of a few small business brands or franchises will do. If no client logos, consider logos of media outlets or awards: e.g., if Arzani was mentioned in TechCrunch or The Telegraph, putting “As seen in [TechCrunch logo] [TechNation logo] etc.” can add huge credibility. Industry affiliations can also go here (like partner networks, or if Arzani is part of an incubator or has investors, their logos with a caption “Backed by…”). Logos work best typically in a horizontal row or grid, often in grayscale to blend with a professional tone, introduced by a line like “Trusted by businesses and organizations such as:​

】.
Statistics and Numbers: People trust numbers. If Arzani can claim something like “£X million in deals facilitated” or “1000+ valuations performed”, those big round numbers can impress. We can display these in a bold typographic style. For instance:
1,200+ free valuations delivered to UK business owners.
98% satisfaction rate among Arzani users (if we had survey data or NPS).
50+ businesses sold in the last year via Arzani.
These kind of metrics, if available, should be highlighted. If Arzani is new and numbers are small, we might skip this or focus on growth rate or unique value instead. But since the prompt suggests outperforming Rightbiz, presumably Arzani wants to project strength, so any positive metric helps. Even a small number can be framed positively: e.g., “Join dozens of savvy owners who’ve tried Arzani this month.” It implies momentum.
Awards/Badges: Display any award (e.g., “UK Business Marketplace of the Year 2025” if it existed) or badges like ISO certified, or rating badges (like if there was a Trustpilot or Capterra rating). For example, showing 5 stars and “Rated 4.8/5 by our users” is quick social proof. Or a badge like “Google for Startups Alumni” if applicable. These lend third-party validation – someone else vouches for Arzani. Leadfeeder suggests using awards or certifications to win trus​

】.
Security/Privacy Seals: While not social proof per se, things like a Norton Secured or GDPR compliant icon can increase trust (especially when users are about to input data). We can place a small lock icon with “GDPR Compliant” near the form submit, as mentioned. It signals that Arzani respects privacy and security – critical for a platform dealing with confidential business info.
Placement of Social Proof: We integrated testimonials in a dedicated section after the solution. That’s good, but also consider sprinkling micro-proof elsewhere:
Perhaps place a short testimonial blurb or a star-rating right under the hero as an immediate trust signal. For example, below the CTA in hero, a small text: “★ ★ ★ ★ ★ Rated 5/5 by business owners like you” (if true) or a rotating one-line testimonial (“‘Arzani made selling my business easy’ – [Name]”). This way, even those who don’t scroll much see a form of social proof right away.
We have a main social proof section with multiple testimonials and logos – that’s great to reinforce mid-page.
Near the final CTA, we could echo a tiny proof element again (like “Join others who have succeeded – 50 businesses sold this year!” near the bottom CTA). That final nudge can reassure right before clicking.
Authenticity and Specificity: The more specific the social proof, the more credible. A testimonial saying “Great service!” is far weaker than one that says “With Arzani, we got 3 offers within a month and sold above asking. I saved £10k by not using a broke​
rightbiz.co.uk
】.” The latter has detail (3 offers, 1 month, £10k saved). Encourage testimonials that mention concrete results or measurable outcomes, as these are convincin​
rightbiz.co.uk
】. Even a quote like “...their careful risk assessments helped me make an informed decision​
arzani.co.uk
】 from the Arzani site’s testimonial is nice and specific to buying decisions. Use such specifics from any existing user feedback (the content we saw in Arzani’s FAQ/testimonials can be repurposed as quotes with permission).
Credibility through Content and Tone: It’s not just explicit social proof that builds credibility – the overall tone and quality of content do as well. Our copy’s professional tone, correct grammar, and helpful information all contribute to the impression that Arzani is a legitimate, expert company. Sloppy copy or design can erode trust. Also, being transparent in the FAQ (like admitting “accuracy ~90%” rather than claiming 100%) ironically increases credibility because it shows honesty. Peep Laja often notes that clarity and honesty beat hype in B2B. So all our credibility elements should feel genuine. If Arzani is new and doesn’t have a lot of customers, it’s better to have one or two real, solid testimonials than five fake-sounding generic ones. Quality over quantity for trust elements.
Leverage Experts and Leadership: Another form of credibility is expert authority. For instance, if Arzani’s founder or team includes notable experts (like “Ex-investment banker” or “Valuation expert with 20 years experience”), that could be subtly mentioned. Perhaps an “About us” blurb or even a quote from the founder: “Our mission is to empower small business owners with AI insights that were once only available to big corporations,” – [Name], Founder of Arzani. This isn’t exactly social proof, but it adds a human face and authority voice. A small photo of the founder with a quote can personalize the brand. However, use this only if it strengthens trust (if the founder has relevant creds or a compelling vision). It shouldn’t distract from the main flow, so maybe as a sidebar or within the FAQ as an answer (“Who are we? We’re a team of X, Y, Z...” briefly).
Case Studies: If time and space permit, a mini-case study could be a powerful credibility booster. It combines story + proof. For example, a short paragraph with a subheading “Success Story: [Business Name]” describing how Arzani helped a specific client, including before/after metrics (like increased sale price or reduced time to sell). End it with that client’s testimonial quote. This can be in the social proof section or in a sidebar. It serves readers who like narrative proof, adding depth beyond one-line quotes.
Third-Party Endorsements: Sometimes, having an industry expert or influencer endorsement can be social proof. E.g., if a known small business consultant or a well-known platform (like a quote from a CEO of a related company or a professor) says something positive about Arzani or its approach (“AI valuations are the future of small business sales” – Dr. So-and-so, Business School). If Arzani has any advisory board or notable backers, mention of that can instill trust (e.g., “Backed by alumni of [prestigious incubator]”). This might be beyond scope, but worth noting as a tactic.
Placement Timing: Make sure by the time a user is considering the CTA, they have encountered some social proof. We wouldn’t want the CTA to appear before any trust has been built. In our layout, hero (CTA) is first, but that’s common – and we ameliorate it by possibly including a micro-proof near it and by quickly following with reasons and proof. As they scroll, they hit social proof mid-way, which should seal trust. And then at the bottom CTA we can remind them of trust (like “Start your free valuation – join others who succeeded”).
Don’t Oversell – Authentic Tone: The credibility elements should feel like testimonials, not advertisements. E.g., use natural language that real customers would use, even if it’s not super polished. A slightly unpolished genuine quote can be more credible than a perfectly phrased one that reads like ad copy. Also, if including any star ratings or such, ensure they match actual reviews somewhere (or state “internal survey” or whatever the source is). Modern audiences are savvy and skeptical; anything that looks too good (all 5-star glowing with zero detail) might ironically reduce trust. Balance praise with realism (for instance, a testimonial might mention they were initially skeptical or had a challenge, which they overcame using Arzani – that actually feels real and thus more persuasive).
Security and Privacy Promises: Since part of credibility is also the safety of using the service, reiterate privacy promises where relevant (we do in FAQ and near CTA). Also, ensure the page uses HTTPS (an SSL certificate) – a “Not secure” browser warning would kill trust immediately. This is basic but worth stating: the landing page must be on a secure URL, especially since users will input data.
By skillfully deploying these social proof and credibility elements, we alleviate the fear of “Is this legit? Will this work for me? Have others had success?” Those are the subconscious questions in a visitor’s mind. After seeing the proof, the hope is the visitor thinks, “Others did it and got great results, the company seems trustworthy and competent – I won’t be the guinea pig. Let’s try this.” That confidence is what tips them into clicking the CTA and becoming a lead.
Conversion-Focused Form Design
Since the primary CTA leads to a form submission (to get a free valuation, likely the user needs to provide some information), the design of that form is crucial for conversion. A poorly designed form can cause drop-offs even after a user clicks “Get My Free Valuation.” Below are best practices to ensure the form is user-friendly and optimized to get that lead info:
Keep the Form Short and Simple: Only ask for the information that is absolutely necessary to start the valuation proces​
cxl.com
】. For a free valuation, that might initially be just a couple of fields: e.g., Business Name, Your Name, Email, Phone (optional). Potentially, you might ask for one key business metric to tailor the valuation (like annual revenue or industry) – but consider if you can avoid that in this first step. Remember, each additional form field can reduce conversion rates (more friction​

】. As Peep Laja notes, a form with 1-3 fields is ideal for lead gen if you can manage i​
cxl.com
】. Perhaps Arzani can generate a basic valuation range with minimal info and then follow up for more details. The initial form should lower the barrier: name and contact might suffice to “lock in” their interest. You can always gather more data later via a follow-up email or call (once the lead is captured).
Multi-Step Form (if needed): If you do need more info for a meaningful valuation (for example, industry, years in business, revenue, profit, etc.), consider a multi-step form rather than one long form. Multi-step forms often convert higher because they don’t overwhelm the user at once. The first step could be just contact info (easy stuff) – once they submit that, step 2 asks business specifics. Many users who complete step 1 will continue (commitment consistency). Also, use a progress indicator (“Step 1 of 2”, “Next: Business Details”) to let them know it’s short. For instance, Step 1: Name & Email; Step 2: 3-4 business questions (perhaps in a conversational tone like “What’s your industry? (dropdown), Approximate annual revenue? (range selection)”). Each step should be on its own screen on mobile to avoid a super long scrolling form.
Inline Form in Hero vs Separate Page: We could place the first part of the form right in the hero section (like an email capture field and button). This can increase conversions for folks ready to get started immediately. For example, a single-field “Enter your email to get started” with the CTA. However, an argument could be made to not show the form until they click the CTA (to not intimidate those who need persuasion first). This is something to test. One approach is: have the CTA button in hero open a lightbox form or scroll to a form section labeled “Get Your Free Valuation.” This way, those who click are showing intent and then see the form. Alternatively, an embedded mini-form (name, email, submit) in the hero can capture quick wins. If doing that, ensure the form is very short (just one or two fields), and you can collect the rest later. For example, “Get my free valuation” in hero could actually be an email field + button. Pressing it either submits and then shows step 2 or at least captures email so if they abandon later, you still got a lead to follow up with.
Form Field Design: Design fields with clear labels. Place labels above the field or inside as placeholders but if using placeholders, ensure that upon focus out the typed text is clearly visible and the user doesn’t forget what the field was. Many modern forms use floating labels (the text moves above as a mini-label when you start typing). That can be nice for saving space and clarity. Use helpful defaults where possible (e.g., a dropdown for industry pre-filled with “Select industry”). Mark optional fields clearly if any (and consider making most fields optional except maybe contact info, to reduce friction – you can follow up to get missing data).
Error Handling and Validation: Implement real-time validation to catch errors before submission. For instance, if the email format is wrong, show a small red hint “Please enter a valid email” as they move off the field. When they hit submit, if something’s missing, highlight the field in red and give a helpful message. Make sure the error messages are in plain language (e.g., “Please fill in your business name” rather than a generic “Field required”). This prevents frustration. Also, ensure that if the user does encounter an error, the form doesn’t wipe all their inputs – nothing is more annoying than filling details, getting an error, and losing everything typed. Always preserve what they entered so they can just correct one field.
Privacy Reassurance: Right below the form or submit button, include a note about privacy. For instance, “💡 Your valuation is confidential. We won’t share your data with anyone.” or “We respect your privacy and will only use your info to provide your valuation.” This is especially important in B2B because owners are protective of their business info. A reassurance can increase their willingness to submit the form. Also provide a link to the privacy policy (could be a small text link “Privacy Policy”) – but have it open in a modal or new tab so they don’t completely navigate awa​

】.
Call-to-Action on Submit Button: The submit button on the form should continue the same phrasing: e.g., “Get My Free Valuation” (if it’s the final step) or “Next: See My Valuation” if multi-step. If multi-step, the final step’s button could say “Get My Valuation Report” to indicate this click finishes the process. Make the button full-width on mobile for easy tapping. Also, consider using a contrasting color consistent with earlier CTA buttons.
Loading/Success Feedback: After clicking submit, provide immediate feedback. For example, change the button to a loading spinner or “Submitting…” state so the user knows it’s processing. Then show a thank-you or confirmation message. Possibly, the landing page could then either:
Display a confirmation text in place of the form (e.g., “Thank you! Your valuation is being prepared. We’ll reach out to you at [email].” and perhaps what to expect next).
Or redirect to a dedicated thank-you page with next steps (which could be an opportunity to upsell or provide more info).
The key is to finalize the conversion loop with a positive reinforcement. Even something like “Success! Check your email for your valuation report within X hours” if it’s not instant, or “Success! Our team will contact you within one business day to personally review your valuation.” Setting the expectation manages the relationship going forward.
Minimize Friction and Cognitive Load: Use smart defaults if available. For instance, if the valuation is presumably for UK businesses only (Arzani is UK-based), maybe default country = UK so they don’t have to fill that. If there’s a phone field, pre-format or auto-detect country code. If industry field, provide a dropdown or auto-suggest so they don’t have to type from scratch. Each little convenience helps. Also, avoid asking for information that might be sensitive right off the bat. For example, owners might hesitate to provide detailed financials to an unknown platform through a form. It might be better to get basic contact info and then have an analyst follow up for financial details, or at least reassure them that any detailed info will be handled securely (with NDA if needed). Our form should feel easy and safe to fill.
Accessible Forms: Ensure form fields have proper labels for screen readers. Also, the form should be navigable by keyboard (for accessibility and for power users who prefer keyboard). This also means the focus outline should be visible when tabbing through fields (don’t remove outline in CSS without providing an alternative). While many of Arzani’s users will be sighted and using mouse/touch, catering to all users is part of good practice and sometimes legally required (accessibility).
Mobile Form Considerations: On mobile, when the on-screen keyboard pops up, it can occlude half the screen. Make sure the form is designed such that when you focus a field on mobile, it scrolls into view above the keyboard (so the user isn’t typing blindly). Also keep fields minimal to reduce typing. Possibly integrate device capabilities – e.g., allow voice dictation (that’s more on the user’s side with their keyboard). For phone number, the numeric keypad makes entry easier.
Use of Captcha/Spam Prevention: If the form is publicly accessible, consider how to avoid spam bot submissions (which can pollute leads). A simple Google reCAPTCHA v3 (invisible) can be used, or at least a honeypot field (an invisible field that humans won’t fill but bots might, to filter them). However, don’t use a clunky CAPTCHA that the user has to solve (like image selection) unless spam becomes a problem – those can hurt conversion significantly due to annoyance. Aim for behind-the-scenes solutions.
Form Placement on Landing Page: If we implement as a two-step (CTA then form), the landing page itself might not show the full form until CTA is clicked. If the form is part of the page content (like a separate section or the hero), ensure it’s visually appealing. Often, a form can be placed inside a bordered box or with a slight background shade to stand out. For example, a light grey panel with the form fields, making it clear it’s an input area. Use concise instructional text if needed above the form: e.g., “Get started with your free valuation – just fill out the details below:” This can set context. We had that in the final CTA section plan (essentially repeating invitation to fill the form).
Offer Help on the Form: Sometimes putting a small help link like “Need help? Contact us.” near the form can catch people who might be stuck or have last-minute doubts. This could open a chat or bring them to a contact page. Alternatively, if Arzani has live chat, a chat widget can pop up especially on the form page saying “Have questions? Chat with us while you fill this out.” That can rescue conversions that might otherwise abandon. If doing this, ensure the chat widget doesn’t cover the form fields (place it bottom corner out of the way).
By focusing on form UX in these ways, we ensure that once a user decides to convert, nothing in the form stops them. The mantra is “Don’t make me think” – the form should be intuitive. Many landing page efforts fail not because the user isn’t convinced, but because the final conversion step (the form) is tedious or confusing. We will avoid that trap, keeping the form as a smooth final leg of the journey.
A/B Testing Recommendations
After implementing the landing page with all these best practices, continuous improvement comes from A/B testing (split testing). The idea is to empirically find what actually boosts conversions by testing one variant against another with real traffic. Here’s a plan for A/B testing Arzani’s landing page and what elements to focus on:
Prioritize High-Impact Elements: Not all parts of the page are equal in influence. Based on experience and research, the elements to test first (in order) are:
Headline and Hero Copy: The headline is often a make-or-break element. Test different versions of the headline. For example, Version A (current): “Designed for UK Small Businesses to Buy, Sell, and Scale” vs. Version B: “Sell Your Business 37% Faster with AI-Powered Valuations.” The latter is more specific and benefit-oriented. Or test a pain-focused headline vs. a solution-focused one. You can also test the subheadline or tweak the value proposition phrasing. Keep one version more straightforward, another maybe with a different angle (but still clear). See which yields higher conversion (form submissions). If one clearly outperforms, adopt that style going forward.
CTA Text/Design: We could test “Get My Free Valuation” vs “Get Your Free Valuation” vs “Get Started – Free Valuation”. It’s a minor copy difference, but sometimes one phrasing clicks better with user​
unbounce.com
】. Also, test CTA design aspects like color: e.g., an orange button vs a blue button (ensuring both are high contrast on page). Run that test and see which color draws more clicks. Another test: having the form directly in the hero vs. a button that opens the form. The metric would be overall conversions (completed forms). If embedding the form yields more completed forms (some studies have shown it can), we’d switch to that approach.
Page Length and Depth of Info: Test a long-form page (including all sections as we’ve planned) vs a shorter page that maybe cuts out some content (for instance, remove the detailed feature section and condense benefits, or remove some FAQs). Some audiences respond better to a concise page that gets right to the point, especially if they came from a trusted referral. Others need all the detail and persuasion. You won’t know for sure until you test. Create a shorter variant that still has the essentials: hero, short pain/solution, one testimonial, CTA. If the short version converts nearly as well or better, that’s insight (maybe users don’t need all the detail). If the long version wins, it means those extra sections are providing needed assurance.
Social Proof Emphasis: Test different social proof approaches. For example, Version A: testimonials (as in our page), vs Version B: a more stats/number-driven approach (like a big banner “1,000+ businesses trust Arzani” plus logos, and maybe fewer testimonials). See which resonates more. Alternatively, test presence or absence of a particular testimonial that might be very strong – does adding a specific high-profile testimonial increase conversion?
Imagery: Test the hero image or visual. Version A could have, say, an illustration of people shaking hands on a business deal; Version B might have a screenshot of the Arzani platform/interface. Or A: friendly human image, B: more techy abstract image. This can tell you what kind of visual your audience responds to (emotional human connection vs seeing the product). Keep everything else same while testing image. Similarly, test adding a short explainer video in the hero vs. just static image – sometimes videos increase engagement, other times they distract or slow load. If Arzani can produce a 1-minute intro video, that could be an interesting test (monitor both conversion and engagement metrics).
Form Variations: If using multi-step form, test single-step vs multi-step (does breaking it actually improve completion?). Or test fewer fields vs a version with one extra required field to gauge impact on lead quality vs quantity. For example, test requiring phone number vs making it optional. If requiring phone drops conversion significantly, you might decide to keep it optional or off. If it doesn’t hurt much, requiring it might give you more qualified leads ready for sales follow-up. Always weigh lead quality too – a slightly lower conversion rate might be acceptable if the leads are much more qualified. You can measure quality by looking at how many leads turn into actual sales or serious conversations.
Personalization/Segmentation: If feasible, test separate landing pages for sellers vs buyers vs acquirers. For example, run an ad campaign for “sell your business” that goes to a variant page tailored entirely to sellers (headline: “Sell Your Business…”, content focused on selling), versus the generic combined page. Compare conversion rates between targeted vs generic. If the targeted performs better, it may be worth maintaining multiple versions for different audiences. Tools exist to dynamically swap content based on ad parameters (e.g., using Unbounce’s Dynamic Text Replacement or custom scripts) – you could personalize the headline to say “Sell Your [Industry] Business” if the ad passed an industry parameter, etc. Those advanced tests can significantly boost relevance when done right.
Test One Major Change at a Time: To attribute results, run tests where the two versions differ in one significant aspect. Don’t create completely two different pages with dozens of changes – you won’t know which element caused the difference. For instance, test headline alone (keeping rest same). Then test CTA color separately, etc. An exception is you can test two entirely different design concepts (multivariate), but that’s usually later after testing key pieces. Early on, isolate variables for clarity.
Measure the Right Metrics: The primary metric is conversion rate (form submissions as a percentage of unique visitors). Secondary metrics could be click-through rate on the CTA (for parts of funnel), but ultimately a submitted lead is what matters. If using multi-step, measure how many start vs finish to see if drop-off is at a certain question. Use analytics (like Google Analytics or built-in landing page analytics) to track scroll depth and time on page too: if users aren’t scrolling far, maybe your content arrangement needs adjusting (like important info higher). A/B testing tools (Google Optimize, Optimizely, VWO, etc.) can handle the random traffic split and statistical significance calculation.
Statistical Significance & Traffic: Ensure you run the test long enough to get a significant sample. In B2B, traffic might be lower volume, so be patient. For example, if your baseline conversion is 10% and you want to detect a lift to 12%, you might need a few hundred visitors per variant to be sure. Many A/B testing calculators are available to estimate needed sample. Run tests for at least 1-2 full business cycles (like over different days of week) to account for variability. Don’t stop a test early just because one variant seems ahead – early fluctuations can even out. Aim for 95% confidence level before declaring a winner.
Qualitative Feedback During Testing: Alongside quantitative tests, gather qualitative data. Use a tool for user session recordings or heatmaps (like Hotjar or Crazy Egg) to see where people click or where they may get stuck. Consider a small exit survey: “What stopped you from getting a valuation today?” – this can reveal if a certain objection wasn’t addressed or if the form was too long, etc. This qualitative insight can generate new test ideas. For instance, if many say “I’m just browsing, not ready to sell now,” maybe test adding content that says “Even if you’re not ready to sell yet, a valuation can help you plan” to see if that improves conversions of early-stage visitors.
Test Continuous, but One at a Time: You can have a testing roadmap: first headline, then CTA, then length, etc. Each test can build on the last. When you find a winner, adopt it and then test the next thing on that new version. Over time, you’ll zero in on the most effective combination. Just be careful to reset or account for any seasonality or campaign changes when comparing results. It’s an iterative optimization process.
Don’t Forget to Test Content Tone: We assume professional tone is best (and likely it is for this context). But it could be interesting down the line to test a slightly more conversational or bold tone in copy. Perhaps test a version of the headline that’s more provocative (e.g., “Your Business Is Worth More Than You Think. Find Out How Much – Free.”) versus the baseline. Or test adding humor vs staying formal. These are finer points, but sometimes a touch of personality can differentiate in a sea of bland B2B pages. However, always ensure clarity is not compromised for cleverness unless you have strong reason to believe the clever message resonates bette​
unbounce.com
】. Those kinds of tests make sense once the basics (clarity, structure) are nailed.
Segment Testing: Look at whether different segments behave differently. For example, maybe mobile users convert less – you might A/B test something specifically for mobile (like sticky CTA vs none). Or perhaps traffic from Google Ads vs organic search responds differently – you might run separate experiments for those segments (with tools that allow targeting by referrer or UTM parameters). This way you optimize for each key segment of traffic.
Document and Learn: Keep a record of tests run, results, and insights. Over time you’ll build a knowledge base of what messaging works for Arzani’s audience. For example, you might discover “Pain-focused headlines consistently beat benefit-focused ones for our audience” or “Including industry-specific details improves conversion for niche campaigns.” These learnings inform not just the landing page, but broader marketing strategy and even product messaging.
In essence, treat the landing page as a living project. Launch with best practices (like the ones we’ve compiled) but verify them in the field. CRO (Conversion Rate Optimization) is about empirical improvement. Given Rightbiz is a competitor, presumably Arzani might test elements to outperform whatever Rightbiz is doing. For instance, if Rightbiz’s page has one approach to social proof, Arzani can test an alternative approach to see if it resonates more. Over time, Arzani’s landing page will become finely tuned to its audience, giving it a competitive edge.

】. As illustrated in the wireframe above, the landing page is organized into distinct sections:
Hero Section (Top): Highlighted in the wireframe as “Hero”, this area contains the main headline, subheadline, and a prominent CTA button (or form). It occupies the top banner of the page (often with a background color or image). This is where the unique value proposition and primary action are immediately visible.
Testimonials (Social Proof) Section: Immediately following the hero, the wireframe shows a section for Testimonials – typically with short quotes and attributions (e.g., “—Kenny, —Brad” in the image). In practice, this could be one or two powerful testimonials to build trust earl​

】. We might integrate one testimonial here or a rating badge as discussed, while saving a fuller set of testimonials for later. (The wireframe example places testimonials quite high, which is an option we could emulate to front-load trust.)
Feature/Benefits Sections: The wireframe labels “Feature 1” blocks in a vertical sequence, each with text and an image placeholder. This corresponds to our Solution/Benefits and Feature sections. In implementation, each “Feature 1” box could represent one major benefit or feature – e.g., AI Valuation, Market Insights, etc., with a small image or icon to the right (as shown) and descriptive text to the left. The template shows two feature blocks; we could have more or fewer depending on content (we planned around 3-5). These blocks use headings (Feature titles) and supporting text. They are visually separated (perhaps alternating background shades or just spacing) to avoid confusion. The wireframe’s use of repeated “Feature 1” sections indicates a modular approach: you can add as many feature sections as needed in a stack, each explaining one key value poin​

Social Proof Logos Row: Toward the bottom of the wireframe, there is a row with icons labeled under “Social Proof Heading” – these represent Social Proof Logos (e.g., client logos, partner logos, or award icons). The template suggests placing a collection of trust symbols in a band across the pag​

】. In our design, this could be a strip saying “Trusted by:” followed by logos of companies or media. It’s positioned above the final CTA in the wireframe, which is a logical spot after giving details and before asking for action one more time. We might title it something like “Trusted by businesses across the UK” as a heading above the logos.
Final Call-To-Action Section: At the very bottom, the wireframe shows “Heading for Call To Action Bottom” and the CTA buttons (even mobile store badges in the example, which might not apply to us). For Arzani, this final section contains a concise closing statement and the Final CTA button/form. It echoes the hero in theme but is more of a last prompt. In the template, it’s clearly delineated, often with a different background or a bold design to stand out. This is where our “Ready to get started?” text and the big “Get My Free Valuation” button will go, as described. The wireframe indicates this section should be visually distinct (for example, a colored background banner) to catch the ey​

】.
Footer (if any): The wireframe shows a basic footer with site links/newsletter in grey at the bottom. For our landing page, we’d keep the footer minimal – perhaps just the company name and privacy/terms links. The exact content isn’t crucial, but it should not distract or lead the user away. It can be very small. In many dedicated landing pages, the footer is omitted or just a tiny line of text to maximize focus.
Using the Template: The above wireframe provides a blueprint. Arzani’s team can use it as a starting point in a wireframing tool or design software, plugging in the actual copy and images we’ve discussed. Each red label in the image corresponds to sections we’ve broken down:
“Hero” = Hero Section with main pitch and CTA.
“Testimonials” = Social proof (initial testimonial or rating highlight).
“Feature” (repeated) = Key Benefits/Features sections.
“Social Proof Logos” = Additional credibility indicators (logos/awards).
“Call To Action Bottom” = Final CTA.
By following this structure, you ensure logical flow (awareness -> interest -> desire -> action) and cover all critical elements of a high-converting pag​
swipefile.com
】. The annotations help remind what content goes where, and the order is very much aligned with our content plan and copywriting frameworks:
Hero with UVP & CTA (grabs attention, provides a promise).
(Optional early testimonial) to build quick interest/trust.
Problem & Solution (Features/Benefits) in a scroll-friendly format (maintains interest, builds desire with specifics).
Robust Social Proof section (testimonials, logos) reinforcing credibility (fuels desire, reduces anxiety).
Objection Handling (FAQ) – not explicitly shown in the wireframe, but this could be inserted perhaps between features and the final CTA, or as part of the bottom section. We can integrate FAQs as an expandable area perhaps just above the final CTA banner.
Final CTA (push to action).
It’s worth noting that the wireframe we used had a navigation bar in the very top (“Site Name | Category links | Cart”). For our purposes, we would remove those navigation links as discussed (to avoid distraction​
copyhackers.com
】. So, in implementing, exclude the category menu – just keep maybe the logo on top for branding, or a simple header. The template emphasizes simplicity and focus. It’s not cluttered: each section has one main purpose. This is exactly what we want – each block we designed (hero, proof, features, etc.) is fulfilling a role in persuading the visitor. Using this wireframe, Arzani’s designers can create a high-fidelity design, replacing placeholders with real content:
Swap “Landing Page Hero Heading” with our actual compelling headline.
Replace lorem ipsum in features with our benefit statements.
Put real testimonial text in place of those dummy quotes.
Insert Arzani’s or clients’ logos in that social proof row.
Put the actual CTA button labeled properly.
Because the wireframe is already annotated with section labels, it doubles as a checklist to ensure no key section is omitted during design. It can also be shared with stakeholders to communicate the page layout before moving to visual design. In conclusion, this annotated wireframe aligns with the best practices we’ve outlined and provides a visual guide to building Arzani’s landing page. By following it, Arzani can implement the page systematically: section by section, focusing on conversion-centered design (clear value prop, one action, trust elements, no extraneous links​

】. The result will be a landing page that is not only theoretically well-crafted but practically structured for usability and conversion.
Conclusion: By applying the principles, copy frameworks, UX design techniques, and continuous testing strategies detailed in this guide, Arzani can build a landing page that engages its target audience (entrepreneurs, sellers, and SMB buyers), addresses their concerns, and drives them to take action. The combination of persuasive copy (informed by experts like Wiebe, Gardner, and Laja) and user-centric design (fast, clear, mobile-friendly) will give Arzani a competitive advantage. Such a landing page will effectively convert visitors into qualified leads, positioning Arzani.co.uk to outperform competitors like Rightbiz.co.uk and capture a larger share of the marketplace for buying and selling businesses.

Building a High-Converting B2B SaaS Landing Page for Arzani.co.uk
Executive Summary of Crucial Landing Page Principles
A high-converting landing page is laser-focused on driving a single action. It presents a clear value proposition, speaks directly to the target audience’s pain points, and removes anything that might distract or confuse. Key principles include having no extraneous navigation, one primary call-to-action (CTA), a compelling headline that grabs attention, copy that emphasizes the benefit to the user, and strong social proof to build trust​
copyhackers.com
. Every element – from the hero section down to the final CTA – should work together to guide the visitor toward conversion. By leveraging conversion psychology (like addressing the visitor’s problems and showcasing credible proof), employing proven copywriting formulas, and following user experience (UX) best practices, Arzani can significantly outperform competitor pages. The end result should be a professional, persuasive landing page that drives qualified B2B leads to click “Get a free valuation.” Key Objectives:
Clarity & Focus: Communicate Arzani’s unique value (AI-powered business buying/selling) in clear, customer-centric language. Eliminate distractions so the only obvious action is to get a free valuation​
copyhackers.com
.
Conversion-Centric Design: Use an intuitive layout with a strong visual hierarchy. Make the primary CTA highly visible (contrasting button, repeated in strategic spots) and easy to act on, especially on mobile devices​
balsamiq.com
​
leadfeeder.com
.
Trust & Relevance: Build credibility through testimonials, trust badges, and data. Ensure the messaging resonates with entrepreneurs and business owners by addressing their specific pains (e.g. uncertainty in valuing a business, difficulty finding buyers) and offering Arzani as the solution.
Immediate Action: Use persuasive copywriting techniques (like AIDA, PAS – detailed below) to hook visitors from the headline, hold their interest by agitating problems, create desire with solution benefits, and spur action with a compelling CTA. Provide tactical, step-by-step guidance and remove friction (simple form, clear next steps) to maximize conversions.
By implementing these principles and iteratively testing improvements, Arzani’s landing page can become a conversion powerhouse that turns a high percentage of visitors into leads.
Core Landing Page Principles for SaaS
In a B2B SaaS context, certain foundational principles will set your landing page up for success:
Single Focus & CTA: A landing page is not a general website page – it exists to drive one primary goal​
copyhackers.com
. Remove the main site navigation menu and any external links that could lead visitors astray​
copyhackers.com
​
balsamiq.com
. All roads on this page should lead to the “Get a free valuation” action. This singular focus (known as maintaining a 1:1 attention ratio) prevents choice paralysis and keeps users oriented on the desired conversion​
copyhackers.com
.
Clear Value Proposition: Immediately communicate what Arzani offers and why it matters. The headline and subheadline (in the hero section) should convey a compelling unique value proposition (UVP) for your target audience. It should be benefit-oriented and neither boring nor overly sensational​
copyhackers.com
. For example: “AI-Powered Business Valuations to Maximize Your Sale – Fast, Free, and Accurate.” This speaks to owners’ desire for a fast, reliable valuation. A strong UVP answers “What is this, who is it for, and how will it help me?” within seconds of landing on the page.
Customer-Centric Messaging: Craft the copy around the needs and language of your audience. Write the way your audience talks and “join the conversation already happening in their heads”​
unbounce.com
. For instance, entrepreneurs might be thinking “How much is my business worth? Can I trust this process?” Use that insight to shape your messaging. Focus on benefits over features – don’t just say “AI-powered valuations,” explain it as “Get an accurate selling price using AI (so you don’t leave money on the table).” The benefit of the offer must be crystal clear at a glance​
copyhackers.com
.
Benefit-Oriented Headline & Hero: The main headline should grab attention and immediately resonate. Strong headlines often either agitate a pain point or promise a solution (or both)​
leadfeeder.com
. For example, a pain-focused headline could be “Unsure What Your Business is Worth?” (taps into a common anxiety), followed by a subheadline that offers a solution: “Get a FREE, AI-driven valuation and find out in minutes.” This approach speaks directly to a problem and gives hope of a solution. Ensure the language is straightforward and accurate – no jargon or vague buzzwords. In B2B, a professional tone is key, but that doesn’t mean the copy should be dry. It should be easy to read and understand for a busy business owner.
Social Proof & Trust Signals: Social proof supports the conversion by easing the visitor’s skepticism​
copyhackers.com
. Include evidence that others have succeeded with Arzani: testimonials from happy users, logos of companies that have listed or sold through Arzani, number of businesses valued or sold, etc. Seeing that peers trust the platform reassures visitors that Arzani is credible. For a B2B marketplace like Arzani, trust is paramount – owners need confidence before engaging. Use at least two forms of social proof (e.g. a testimonial quote and a badge like “Trusted by 500+ UK businesses”)​
balsamiq.com
. We’ll delve into specific social proof elements later.
Minimal Friction: Make it as easy as possible for someone to convert. This means a short, simple form (name and business email may suffice to start) and a clear, prominent CTA button. According to conversion experts, extra form fields or unnecessary steps add friction – for each additional field, you lose some percentage of sign-ups​
cxl.com
​
cxl.com
. So ask only for information that’s truly needed to deliver the free valuation or qualify the lead. You can always collect more details later. The overall page should also load fast and be mobile-friendly (more on that below) – any technical frustrations can tank your conversion rate even if the copy is great.
Consistency & Relevance: Ensure the landing page message matches any ads or emails that drive traffic to it (this is known as message match). For example, if an AdWords ad says “Sell Your Business – Free Valuation from Arzani,” the landing page should prominently echo “Free Valuation” and “sell your business” in the headline. Consistent messaging assures visitors they’re in the right place. Additionally, maintain brand consistency in design (use Arzani’s branding, colors, and tone) so it feels professional and trustworthy. A cohesive, polished look influences the perception of credibility – research shows people quickly judge a site’s trustworthiness by its design quality.
Appropriate Page Length: As a SaaS/marketplace offering something free, the page doesn’t need to be extremely long, but it must contain enough information to address key questions. A general rule: if the offer is low commitment (free, no obligation), shorter copy can work best, whereas bigger asks (paid products, high commitments) often need longer copy​
cxl.com
​
cxl.com
. Here, since “Get a free valuation” is a low-risk offer, we lean towards concise content. However, because selling or buying a business is a significant, considered decision, Arzani should include essential details to build trust. In practice, that means covering the basics (what it is, how it works, benefits, proof, etc.) without overwhelming. Every section should earn its place by addressing a known user question or motivating the user further – no fluff. If a piece of content doesn’t strengthen the case or address a likely concern, consider removing it​
balsamiq.com
​
balsamiq.com
. This keeps the page focused and impactful.
By adhering to these core principles – clarity, singular focus, benefit-driven messaging, social proof, and reduced friction – Arzani’s landing page will create a seamless journey from interest to conversion. Next, we’ll break down each section of the page and how to apply these principles in detail.
Section-by-Section Breakdown
Below is a breakdown of the recommended landing page structure, with each section’s purpose, content, and best practices. We’ll cover how to craft each part of the page from the top (hero) to bottom (final CTA) in a way that specifically speaks to Arzani’s target audience (buyers, sellers, and SMB acquirers) and drives them to request a free valuation.
Hero Section
What it is: The hero section is the top of the page that users see first. It typically includes the main headline, a supporting subheadline, an eye-catching visual or illustration, and the primary CTA (often as a button or simple lead form). This is arguably the most critical part of the page – it forms the visitor’s first impression in seconds. Objectives: Grab the visitor’s attention immediately, clearly state the value proposition, and make the desired action (getting a valuation) obvious. By the time a visitor finishes reading the hero section, they should know what Arzani offers, how it can help them, and be enticed to learn more or take action. Best Practices & Content:
Compelling Headline: Use a concise headline that connects with a core desire or pain of the target audience​
leadfeeder.com
. For example, a headline like “Sell Your Business with Confidence – Powered by AI” speaks to owners wanting confidence in the selling process. Alternatively, a pain-focused headline might be “Tired of Guessing Your Business’s Value?” which hooks those worried about valuation. According to 2025 best practices, an effective headline can do one or more of the following: speak to a pain point, promise a solution, or present an intriguing hook​
leadfeeder.com
. Choose phrasing that resonates most with Arzani’s primary segment (business owners likely looking to sell) while staying professional. Ensure the headline is prominent and easily readable (use a large font and high contrast with the background).
Subheadline or Supporting Text: Directly below the headline, include a brief subheadline (one or two sentences) that provides a bit more context or a specific benefit. This is your chance to cement the value proposition with details. For instance: “Arzani’s AI-powered marketplace helps you buy, sell, or expand a business faster. Get a free, expert valuation and connect with thousands of qualified buyers.” This reinforces what Arzani does (“AI-powered marketplace to buy/sell/expand”), the benefit (“faster”), and the CTA incentive (“free, expert valuation”). Note how it touches on all target audiences: buyers, sellers, and acquirers – but still the primary CTA is oriented to sellers (valuation). If needed, you can split into two sub-points or a short bullet list highlighting 2-3 top benefits (e.g., “Free Valuation: AI-accurate pricing for your business; Faster Sales: 37% quicker closings than industry average​
arzani.co.uk
; Qualified Buyers: Over X verified buyers waiting”). Keep this supporting copy skimmable and benefit-driven – avoid deep technical detail here, save that for later sections.
Primary Call-to-Action (CTA) Button/Form: The hero should prominently feature the action you want the user to take. This could be a bold button labeled “Get My Free Valuation” that scrolls to a form or opens a sign-up modal. Alternatively (especially on desktop), you might place a lead capture form right in the hero for immediacy – for example, a field for name, business name, and email, with a submit button “Get My Free Valuation”. Many B2B landing pages find that putting a short form above the fold can boost conversion for ready visitors, while others prefer a button that leads to the form to avoid intimidating people with fields too soon. You can test which works best (more on A/B testing later). Whichever approach, make sure the CTA stands out: use a contrasting color that aligns with Arzani’s branding but isn’t used heavily elsewhere on the page (so it catches the eye). The button should look obviously like a button (use a solid fill, not just text)​
balsamiq.com
, and there should be plenty of white space around it so it’s not crowded​
balsamiq.com
. The copy on the button should be clear and use action verbs – e.g. “Get My Free Valuation” is better than a generic “Submit”. First-person phrasing (“Get My…”) can sometimes increase conversion by making it more personal, but you can test “Get Your Free Valuation” vs. “Get My Free Valuation” to see which resonates more.
Hero Image or Background: Include a relevant visual that complements the message without stealing focus. For a SaaS/marketplace like Arzani, this might be a professional illustration or graphic – perhaps an image of a business owner reviewing a report, or an abstract graphic representing data/AI, or even a subtle animation of a valuation dashboard (if available). The image should reinforce what the text is saying. For instance, a graphic showing an upward arrow or growth chart could symbolize “business growth/expansion”, appealing to the SMBs looking to acquire. Make sure any text overlaid on an image is still highly legible (use overlay color or shadows if needed for contrast). A/B test different visuals: sometimes a product screenshot (like a peek at the Arzani valuation interface) can build credibility by showing the tool, while other times a more emotional image (like happy entrepreneurs shaking hands on a deal) can add human appeal. Avoid cheesy or irrelevant stock photos, as they can hurt authenticity​
leadfeeder.com
. If possible, use custom imagery or illustrations that match Arzani’s brand style​
leadfeeder.com
. Keep the design clean – the hero area should not feel cluttered. A simple layout with the headline, short text, and one strong image is ideal.
Professional Tone & Branding: The hero is also where you set the tone. Use a professional but inviting tone – you want to convey expertise and trust (since Arzani deals with significant financial decisions) but also approachability. For example, “Designed for UK Small Businesses to Buy, Sell, and Scale” (from Arzani’s site) is a clear and professional tagline​
arzani.co.uk
. You might incorporate something similar or reuse phrasing from Arzani’s existing messaging to maintain consistency. Make sure the Arzani logo is visible at the top (usually in the header) to establish brand identity, but consider omitting the standard site header navigation on this landing page, or at least minimizing it (you can use a simplified header with just the logo and maybe a contact link). Copyhackers found that removing global navigation is a standard practice on landing pages to avoid distraction​
copyhackers.com
. If you’re concerned about users needing more info, you can include any necessary links (like “Privacy Policy”) in the footer or as a modal, rather than a full menu, which we’ll cover later​
balsamiq.com
.
Above the Fold vs Below: Aim to have the headline, subheadline, and CTA visible above the fold (i.e., without scrolling) for common screen sizes, especially on desktop and tablet. On mobile, “above the fold” is just whatever fits first, which might just be the headline and part of the subheadline – that’s okay, as long as the user knows to scroll for more. Given that many visitors will be on mobile, consider a design where the first thing they see is the key message and a CTA button near the top (perhaps a sticky header with a “Get Valuation” button or a floating bar). Leadfeeder’s 2025 guide emphasizes ensuring CTA buttons are easy to click on mobile and the page responds well to different screen sizes​
leadfeeder.com
.
In summary, the hero section should immediately answer the visitor’s unspoken questions: “Am I in the right place? What’s in it for me? What do I do next?” If we nail that, we’ve cleared the first hurdle in conversion. For Arzani, that means a sharp UVP about simplifying buying/selling businesses with AI, a clear benefit (free valuation or faster acquisitions), and a bold call-to-action that invites them to get started risk-free.
Problem/Agitation Section
What it is: After the hero, it’s effective to next address the problem or pain points that your audience is facing – and agitate them a bit. This is a classic copywriting approach known as Problem-Agitate-Solution (PAS). In this section, you acknowledge the challenges or frustrations that your target users (buyers, sellers, or acquiring SMBs) experience, thereby building empathy and increasing their desire for a solution. Essentially, you’re saying “We get what you’re struggling with – and it doesn’t have to be that way.” Objectives: Resonate with the visitor’s pain to keep them reading. By explicitly outlining their problem, you create a need for the solution that Arzani provides. This section should make them think “Yes, that’s exactly my situation!” and feel the urgency or emotional impact of not solving it. It softens them for the next section (Solution/Benefits) by setting up a contrast. Best Practices & Content:
Head the Section with Empathy: Use a heading or subheading that identifies the problem. It could be phrased as a question or statement. For example: “The Challenge of Buying or Selling a Business” or “Why Selling a Small Business Is Harder Than It Should Be.” This signals to the reader that you understand their world. It can be a slightly emotional or agitation-oriented headline – e.g., “Are You Struggling to Get a Fair Price for Your Business?” – something that grabs them by reflecting their worry. The tone should remain professional (no fear-mongering or exaggeration), but a bit of urgency or concern is okay to introduce here.
Describe the Pain Points: In a short paragraph or a few bullet points, outline the key difficulties your audience faces:
For sellers: “You’ve worked for years building your business, but when it comes time to sell, it’s confusing to know what it’s worth or where to find serious buyers. Traditional brokers charge hefty commissions, and listing sites might leave you waiting months with no guarantee of a good offer.” This hits on uncertainty of valuation, difficulty finding buyers, and cost – likely pains for a small business owner.
For first-time buyers: “You want to buy a business but the process is opaque – listings don’t give the full picture, due diligence is intimidating, and you worry about overpaying or buying a lemon.” This addresses lack of information and risk.
For SMBs looking to acquire: “You’re looking to expand through acquisition, but sourcing quality opportunities is time-consuming, and evaluating a business’s health is complex without the right data.” This touches on the challenge of finding the right fit and analyzing it.
You can combine these points if you want a unified narrative (since Arzani serves all), focusing on a common theme: the market is fragmented and risky for both buyers and sellers. For instance: “Entrepreneurs and business owners often feel lost and frustrated in the business-for-sale marketplace. As a seller, you might fear undervaluing your company or never finding the right buyer; as a buyer, you worry about hidden issues and overpaying. Without expert guidance, buying or selling a business can be slow, confusing, and costly.” Notice how this phrasing identifies with both groups. Highlighting multiple perspectives can work if done succinctly, but be careful not to muddle the message. If Arzani’s primary goal with this page is lead-gen for sellers (the free valuation offer suggests that), you might skew the language more to the seller’s perspective.
Agitate the Problems: Once you’ve stated the problems, twist the knife gently by explaining the implications if these problems aren’t solved. This is where you build urgency. For example: “If you guess your business’s value wrong, you could leave tens of thousands on the table or scare off buyers by overpricing. Listing on generic marketplaces without guidance can mean months with no serious inquiries. Meanwhile, potential buyers might pass you over for more transparent opportunities. It’s an exhausting, uncertain process when you go it alone.” This kind of copy makes the pain more tangible – it connects the problem to a negative outcome the reader wants to avoid (losing money, wasting time, feeling uncertainty). For buyers: “Without reliable data, buying a business can feel like a gamble — one that could cost your company’s savings or derail your growth plans.” The goal is to make the reader really feel “Yeah, this is a big issue. I need to fix this.” In conversion psychology, this leverages a bit of loss aversion – people are motivated to avoid losses (financial loss, lost time, missed opportunities) as much as to achieve gains. Just be truthful and measured; you want to validate their concerns without resorting to scare tactics. The tone should be empathetic concern, not doom and gloom.
Use Storytelling: One effective way to present the problem is through a short story or scenario. For instance, describe “John, a small business owner, tried to sell his company on his own…” and outline his struggles: undervaluation, tire-kicker buyers, time wasted. Then pivot that story in the next section to how things could be different with Arzani. Humans are wired for stories, and a quick narrative can increase engagement​
leadfeeder.com
. You might also mention how typical solutions fail: e.g., “Maybe you’ve tried getting a valuation from a broker, only to get a wide-ranging estimate and a sales pitch for a 10% commission. Or you listed on a generic site and got flooded with unqualified inquiries. These experiences can make you feel like giving up.” This shows you understand their attempts and frustrations, making them more receptive to a new solution (Arzani).
Visual Aids (if appropriate): You could include a simple graphic here to illustrate the problem, such as an icon of a broken puzzle (to signify a broken process) or a frustration emoji, but often this section is text-driven. If you have data that underscores the problem, that can be powerful too. For example, if there’s a statistic like “80% of small business owners don’t know the true value of their business” or “Typical business listings take 6-12 months to sell,” you could cite that to validate the pain. Just ensure any stat is credible and cited. A small infographic or chart could work if it’s clear and supports the narrative.
Segmentation Note: If Arzani eventually decides to have separate landing pages for “Buy a Business” vs “Sell a Business,” the problem section could be tailored on each (one focusing entirely on buyer pains, the other on seller pains). For the purposes of this unified guide, we’re assuming one combined page, so we touch both perspectives. However, keep in mind that clarity trumps breadth – if combining messages, do so carefully. The copy can address both but should still feel cohesive. If it gets too muddled, prioritize the seller’s pain (since the CTA is a valuation for sellers) and perhaps mention buyer pains more briefly or in passing.
The Problem/Agitation section should make the reader hungry for a solution. When done right, it seamlessly sets up the next part of the page, where you present Arzani as the answer to these problems. The emotional build-up here creates a payoff when you deliver a solution that alleviates those frustrations.
Solution/Benefits Section
What it is: This section introduces Arzani as the solution to the pains described earlier and highlights the benefits and outcomes users can expect. It’s where you pivot from problem to solution – essentially the “Solution” part of Problem-Agitate-Solution. You’ll describe what Arzani does (its features or approach) but more importantly how it solves the problems and what benefits the user gains from using it. This is the persuasive heart of the page where you align Arzani’s value with the visitor’s needs. Objectives: Convince the visitor that Arzani is the ideal solution for them. Alleviate the pains mentioned earlier and paint a picture of a better future (successful sale, smooth purchase, business growth) thanks to Arzani. Here, you are turning interest into desire (in AIDA terms). By the end of this section, the prospect should be thinking, “This is exactly what I need – how do I get started?” (which leads naturally to calls-to-action). Best Practices & Content:
Section Headline – Introduce the Solution: Use a positive, solution-oriented headline. Common approaches include phrasing like “Meet Arzani: [Value Proposition]” or “The Solution: A Smarter Way to Buy and Sell Businesses.” For example: “The Solution – Arzani’s AI-Powered Marketplace Puts You in Control.” This flips the tone from the previous “it’s hard” to now “here’s how it becomes easy.” You could also use a results-oriented headline, like “Sell Your Business 37% Faster with AI and Expert Insights” if you want to highlight a specific outcome (that stat was from Arzani’s FAQ: AI-optimized listings selling 37% faster​
arzani.co.uk
). Make sure the headline clearly ties Arzani to solving the aforementioned challenges.
Value Proposition Paragraph: Start with a short paragraph that encapsulates how Arzani solves the issues. For instance: “Arzani is an AI-driven business marketplace designed to eliminate the guesswork and frustration from buying or selling a small business. We combine advanced analytics with human expertise to give you an accurate valuation, targeted buyer-seller matching, and end-to-end support, so you can close deals with confidence.” This type of copy explicitly counters the problems:
It mentions accurate valuation (solving the “don’t know what it’s worth” issue).
Targeted matching (solving “can’t find the right buyer/Business” issue).
End-to-end support (solving “confusing process” issue). Essentially, you’re listing the core benefits in an introductory way.
Notice the use of power words: “eliminate guesswork,” “with confidence.” These trigger positive emotions and assurance. Keep the language benefit-focused. Joanna Wiebe often reminds that people don’t buy a product, they buy a better version of themselves (or their situation) – in this case, they’re not just buying software, they’re buying peace of mind, speed, profit, and growth. Make those benefits front and center.
Bulleted Benefits/Features: It’s often effective to break out key benefits into bullet points or a short list for easy scanning. Each bullet can be a brief feature-benefit statement. For example:
Free AI-Powered Valuation: Instantly get a data-driven valuation with up to 90% accuracy compared to final sale price​
arzani.co.uk
 – so you know exactly what your business is worth before you go to market.
Qualified Buyers & Sellers: Arzani’s platform uses intelligent matching to connect you with serious buyers (or vetted businesses if you’re buying), saving you time on chasing dead-end leads.
37% Faster Sales​
arzani.co.uk
: Our AI-optimized listings sell significantly faster than the industry average, meaning you can close deals in months, not years.
Expert Guidance & Support: Access step-by-step guidance, due diligence tools, and support from our team of experts at every stage, giving you confidence and clarity throughout the process.
No Commissions, No Surprises: (If Arzani’s model is no commission) Sell your business without paying broker commissions – a transparent process with no hidden fees.
Tailor these bullets to Arzani’s actual strengths. The Arzani FAQ gives hints: it talks about AI analytics, personalized matching, comprehensive due diligence assistance​
arzani.co.uk
, faster sales, accuracy of valuations, etc. Use those unique selling points. Each bullet should clearly state a feature (what Arzani provides) and tie it to a benefit (what result or relief the user gets). The format “Feature: explanation – benefit (so that... )” is a good approach. The text in bold draws attention to the feature, and the rest of the line sells the benefit. For readability, limit to ~3-5 bullet points. You want to cover the major points but not turn it into a laundry list. Think: what are the top 3 or 4 reasons someone should choose Arzani over doing it themselves or using a competitor like Rightbiz? Emphasize those.
Differentiators (Why Arzani): Make it clear why Arzani is different and better. If not already covered in the bullets, explicitly address it. Arzani’s differentiator is the AI-driven, data-rich approach in a space that traditionally might be just classifieds or brokers. You might say: “Unlike traditional marketplaces or brokers, Arzani integrates AI-powered analytics and valuation tools to provide deep insights into business performance, market trends, and growth opportunities – support that traditional brokers simply can’t match​
arzani.co.uk
.” This line, adapted from Arzani’s own materials, positions Arzani as a modern solution versus old-school methods​
arzani.co.uk
. If Rightbiz (the competitor) is known, you can allude to common shortcomings in other services without naming them explicitly: e.g., “Other platforms may let you list a business, but they don’t guide you through valuation or vet buyers. Arzani does.” This creates a subtle competitive comparison and shows Arzani has thought of everything.
Use Concrete Data/Proof: Incorporate any quantitative proof points as we did with “37% faster” or “90% accuracy”. Numbers draw the eye and add credibility. If Arzani has any impressive stats (X number of businesses sold, Y average NPS score, etc.), those could be mentioned either here or in a nearby social proof section. Since this is the benefits section, something like “Over 500 businesses valued in 2025” or “£50M+ in business transactions facilitated” (hypothetical examples) could reinforce that Arzani is established and effective. Just be sure any stat is factual. If Arzani is new and stats are modest, it might be better to focus on the qualitative benefits rather than numbers.
Visual Elements: This section can be paired with visuals to reinforce each benefit. For example, you might have a 2-column layout: text on one side, image on the other, and alternate as you go through bullet points. Some ideas:
A screenshot of the Arzani valuation tool or dashboard (showing perhaps a valuation result or analytics chart) to underline the “AI-powered insight” feature.
An image of a successful sale – e.g., a business “Sold” stamp or a happy business owner – to go with “faster sales”.
Icons: using simple icons for each bullet (like a valuation icon, a speedometer for faster, a handshake for matching, a shield for secure/trust, etc.) can make the list more engaging and easier to scan.
Ensure images are high-quality and professional. Each image/graphic should have a purpose (avoid purely decorative images that don’t add meaning, as they can distract​
cxl.com
). Also, ensure the visuals have consistent style and don’t clash with the page design.
Tie Back to Emotions: While listing benefits, subtly tie back to the emotional aspect. It’s not just about logic (save time, get money) but also feelings: peace of mind, confidence, relief, empowerment. For instance, “so you can close deals with confidence” or “so you feel secure in your decisions” are phrases that speak to emotional outcomes. In B2B, buyers are often driven by avoiding risk and looking competent. Arzani’s solution should make them feel like they are making a smart, safe choice – emphasize that emotional payoff.
After this Solution/Benefits section, the visitor should be nodding along, thinking “This sounds great. This addresses exactly what I’m worried about.” We’ve effectively shown how Arzani wipes away the pain and delivers gains. The next step is often to reinforce credibility (since anyone can claim these benefits, we need to prove it – that’s where social proof comes in). Transition to Social Proof: A nice way to segue is a line like “And it’s not just us saying this – our users’ success stories speak for themselves.” Then you introduce the Social Proof section with testimonials or case studies. This logical flow – problem, solution, then proof – is a time-tested conversion sequence.
Social Proof Section
What it is: The social proof section provides evidence that real people or organizations have used Arzani and achieved positive results. It builds trust by showing that Arzani isn’t just making claims – it has satisfied users backing it up. Social proof can take many forms, but common ones on landing pages are testimonials, case studies, client logos, awards, and ratings. The goal is to reassure and convince skeptics by leveraging the influence of others’ experiences (“if people like me had success, I can trust this service”). Objectives: Establish credibility and reduce anxiety. By the end of this section, prospects should feel “Okay, other business owners have done this and it worked – I believe this can work for me too.” This section plays to the psychological principle of consensus (bandwagon effect) – people tend to follow the actions of others, especially peers or experts. It’s especially important in B2B, where decisions are often high stakes; seeing endorsements can tip the balance from doubt to trust. Best Practices & Content:
Testimonials: Include a few short testimonials from users that reflect each of your key audiences if possible. For example, one from a seller, one from a buyer, etc. A strong testimonial should describe the person’s initial situation or hesitation, and then the result they got with Arzani (ideally with a specific outcome). For instance:
“I was unsure what my company was worth or how to even begin selling it. Arzani’s valuation was a game-changer – they pegged the value perfectly and connected me with multiple interested buyers in just weeks. I sold my business above asking price in 3 months. I couldn’t be happier!” – John D., Small Business Owner.
“After months of searching on other sites, I found a great business to acquire through Arzani in a fraction of the time. Their due diligence tools helped me feel confident about the purchase. We expanded our portfolio with zero hiccups.” – Sarah L., Entrepreneur & First-Time Buyer.
Try to get real quotes from any early users of Arzani (if available). Authenticity is key – use real names, company names (if they allow), locations, etc., to make it tangible. Even better, include a photo of the person next to their quote (a smiling headshot). Seeing a face boosts trust and relatability. Make sure to get permission and stick to privacy rules; since Arzani is UK-based, ensure GDPR compliance for using someone’s name/photo in marketing (likely fine with consent). Format-wise, you could have these testimonials in speech bubble or quote formats, maybe sliding in a carousel if space is tight (but also consider just showing them all vertically if room, to avoid relying on the user to click through). Joanna Wiebe notes that social proof should support the CTA​
copyhackers.com
 – so pick testimonials that specifically address and eliminate common objections (e.g., fear of not selling, fear of complexity). “One week with Rightbiz and I had several interested buyers... Very pleased!” is how Rightbiz shows a quick success​
rightbiz.co.uk
 – Arzani should highlight similar success or satisfaction, ideally even more impressively.
Key Metrics or Achievements: Sometimes social proof is presented as quick stats or achievements. If Arzani has any impressive numbers, consider highlighting them in a visually distinct way (like large bold text or an infographic style). For example:
“500+ businesses sold using Arzani”
“£200M in total deal value facilitated”
“4.9★ average user rating”
“85% of first-time sellers get a deal within 6 months on Arzani”
“Backed by [Industry Association]” or “Awarded Best Fintech Startup 2025” (if true).
These are hypothetical – use whatever Arzani can truly claim. Even something like “Trusted by business owners across the UK – from cafes to tech startups” can work if you don’t have hard numbers yet. The idea is to convey that others have taken this path, and it worked out well.
Customer Logos / Brands: If Arzani already has users or clients that are okay to name-drop, show their logos (especially if any are well-known in their sector). A row of logos of businesses that have been bought/sold on the platform (or investors, or partners) can provide instant trust. For example, Rightbiz might show logos of notable franchises or companies sold through them. Arzani could show recognizable SME logos or at least a variety of business types to signal breadth. Label this section as “Trusted by” or “Our customers include” if using logos. Keep logos monochrome or same size for a clean look, and don’t over-crowd – 5 or 6 is plenty to show social proof without diluting.
Trust Badges/Seals: If applicable, include any badges like certifications, security seals, or affiliations. For instance: “ICO Registered” (for data protection), “GDPR Compliant”, or membership logos of professional bodies (e.g., “Member of the UK Business Brokers Association” if that exists, or a Tech Nation fintech badge, etc.). These elements address trust on a more institutional level, showing Arzani is legitimate and adheres to standards​
leadfeeder.com
. Another example: if Arzani’s valuations are vetted by chartered accountants or something, a badge or note stating “Valuations verified by certified professionals” could help.
Case Study Snippet (optional): If Arzani has a great success story, you could include a very brief case study. E.g., “Case Study: Rebecca, a first-time buyer, used Arzani to purchase her dream business – an e-commerce store. With Arzani’s help, she navigated due diligence and closed the deal 40% faster than the industry norm. ‘I was initially nervous...but their step-by-step guidance turned my fears into assurance’ she says. Today, Rebecca proudly owns a thriving business​
arzani.co.uk
.” This mixes narrative with testimonial. It’s longer, so use sparingly – maybe highlight one standout story that will resonate with many readers.
Format & Design: This section should stand out visually as a testimonial section. Often, landing pages will use a slightly different background color or a quotation mark iconography to differentiate it. For example, a light grey background with italic text for quotes, or a big quote symbol behind the text. Ensure text is still readable. You can use carousel dots or arrows for multiple testimonials, but also consider a static multi-column layout if space permits (e.g., two testimonials side by side). If using logos, you might place them just below or above the testimonials, with a heading like “Trusted by businesses across the UK:” and then logos.
Authenticity: Make sure the tone of testimonials feels genuine. Visitors can sniff out overly generic or fake-sounding quotes. So if you don’t have actual testimonials yet (if Arzani is new), it may be worth running a beta with a few users to gather real feedback, rather than inventing quotes. If you must fabricate or stylize something for the sake of the mockup, keep it realistic and then replace with real ones as soon as possible. The credibility of the whole page hinges on honesty – trust is hard to earn, easy to lose.
According to UX best practices, using at least two forms of social proof is recommended​
balsamiq.com
. For instance, testimonials and trust badges, or testimonials and customer logos. This section, combined with earlier factual claims, should cover that. The presence of both qualitative (quotes) and quantitative (numbers, logos) proof appeals to both emotional and logical validators in the visitor’s mind. After reading the social proof section, an on-the-fence visitor should feel their skepticism diminishing: “These people succeeded with Arzani. This platform is legitimate and effective. I won’t be a guinea pig; I’ll be in good company.” That’s exactly the reassurance needed before they encounter another call-to-action or more details. Typically, right after social proof, you might present more details about features or how it works (to address any remaining questions), and then finally drive to the CTA again. So next, we break down features/benefits in more detail (for those who need more information before converting).
Feature/Benefit Section
What it is: This section provides a more detailed look at Arzani’s features and how they benefit the user. Think of it as an expansion of the earlier solution highlights, often presented in a visually structured way. In SaaS landing pages, this is commonly done as a series of feature blocks or cards, sometimes with icons or illustrations, that each focus on a specific aspect of the service. It’s a chance to educate the prospect on what they’ll get and assure them that the product is robust and thought-through. Objectives: Answer the question “What exactly do I get?” and link each feature to a benefit that matters to the customer. For those who are detail-oriented or not yet fully convinced, this section provides the evidence and specifics to back up the broader claims made earlier. It also helps address secondary questions a lead might have about how the platform works. Essentially, we are reinforcing value and preemptively handling questions by showing the tangible components of Arzani. Best Practices & Content:
Organize by Theme: Identify the core components or pillars of Arzani’s platform. Based on what we know, possible pillars could be: 1) AI Valuation, 2) AI Market Insights, 3) Marketplace Listings & Matching, 4) Secure Data & Transactions, 5) Expert Support/Advisory. Each of these is a “feature set” that can be showcased. Arzani’s site itself lists things like Business Valuation, Market Insights, Brain AI, etc., which suggests some key features​
arzani.co.uk
. For the landing page, you might condense into 3-5 major feature blocks, each with a short title and a brief description.
Feature Title and Description: For each feature, have a short title (could be the name of the feature or a benefit-oriented tagline) and 2-3 sentence description. Example format:
AI-Powered Business Valuation – Get precise insights into your business’s worth. Arzani’s advanced AI analyzes over 100 factors (financials, industry trends, comparables) to deliver an instant valuation with 85-90% accuracy against actual sale prices​
arzani.co.uk
. No more guesswork – you’ll price your business right to attract serious buyers.
Data-Driven Market Insights – Make informed decisions with real-time data. Our Brain AI continuously monitors market trends, buyer demand, and sector performance​
arzani.co.uk
. You receive up-to-date analytics and growth forecasts, so whether you’re buying or selling, you can act at the right time and maximize value.
Smart Buyer-Seller Matching – Reach the right people, fast. Arzani’s marketplace isn’t just a listing directory – it’s an intelligent matchmaker. We promote your listing to buyers who are actively searching for similar opportunities, and we filter inquiries to connect you with serious, qualified prospects (no tire-kickers). Buyers likewise get tailored recommendations. This targeted approach means deals happen faster and with less friction.
Secure & Confidential Transactions – Your data and deal are safe with us. We use enterprise-grade encryption and secure portals for sharing sensitive documents​
arzani.co.uk
. List your business confidentially (you control what info is revealed) and communicate through our platform anonymously until you’re ready. With role-based access controls and compliance with GDPR standards, you can trust that your privacy is protected every step of the way​
arzani.co.uk
.
Expert Guidance and Support – You’re never alone in the process. From valuation to closing, Arzani’s team of experts and AI Assistant guide you. Get answers to your questions via our FAQ or chat, and receive personalized tips to improve your listing (like how to present financials attractively). Our support ensures you avoid pitfalls and follow best practices, making the complex process of buying/selling a business simple and clear.
These are illustrative. Tailor each to Arzani’s actual features. Notice each point ties a feature (AI valuation, matching, security, support) to a benefit (price right, faster deals, privacy, simplicity). Keep the descriptions concise; aim for 40-80 words each. Use positive language and second person (“you”) where appropriate to continue focusing on the user.
Visual Icons or Illustrations: Each feature can be accompanied by an icon or small image that represents it. For example:
A scale or graph icon for Valuation.
A chart or trend line icon for Market Insights.
A network or handshake icon for Matching.
A lock or shield icon for Security.
A headset or person icon for Support.
Using a consistent icon style (line icons or flat icons in Arzani’s brand color palette) will make this section visually appealing and scannable. Another approach is using small screenshots for each feature (if the product has distinct screens for these functions), but that can sometimes clutter the page or be hard to see on mobile. Icons or simple illustrations often communicate more quickly. The swipefile analysis highlighted “Feature Highlights: Clearly displays important features with supporting visuals” as a positive aspect of a landing page​
swipefile.com
, so we should emulate that.
Layout: Often features are laid out in a grid (e.g., 3 across on desktop, stacking on mobile). If you have an odd number like 5, you might do 3 in one row, 2 in the next. Make sure each feature block has some breathing room (whitespace) around it so it’s distinct. Alternatively, you can do a vertical stacked approach, where each feature block spans full width: e.g., icon/title, then text. But that can become a long scroll. A balanced grid or two-column layout is usually better for keeping it compact yet digestible. Also consider alternating sides if using images: e.g., feature 1: icon on left, text on right; feature 2: text on left, icon on right; etc., to create a nice flow.
Link Benefits to Conversion: Subtly remind why each feature matters in terms of the end goal (selling or buying a business successfully). For instance, in the above examples, each ended with an outcome: price right, deals faster, privacy, simplicity, etc. This ensures the prospect sees these not just as “cool tools” but as means to achieve their goal.
Address Unspoken Questions: This feature section is also a good place to answer “How does this work?” types of questions. For example, the security feature addresses “Will my information be safe/confidential?” The support feature addresses “Will I have help or am I on my own?” The matching feature addresses “How will I find the right buyer/business?” Think about common objections or doubts and make sure the features cover them. If there’s an objection that none of these features cover directly, perhaps integrate the answer into one of them or include an extra point. For instance, one might worry “Is this platform for me if I’m just exploring?” Arzani in its FAQ said they have a Basic plan for research​
arzani.co.uk
 – that could be woven into the support or insights feature: e.g., “Even if you’re not ready to sell immediately, Arzani’s insights help you prepare and time your move. (We even offer a free research plan for exploring the market.)”
At this stage, the visitor has learned why Arzani is valuable (Solution/Benefits) and what Arzani includes and does (Features/Details). The combination of these sections should address both emotional and logical considerations. Now, before pushing them to a final CTA, it’s wise to handle any remaining doubts explicitly. That’s where an Objection Handling / FAQ section comes in. It can directly tackle questions or concerns that haven’t been addressed yet. We’ll do that next.
Objection Handling
What it is: The objection handling section is often presented as an FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) or a final Q&A segment on the landing page. It targets the common objections or doubts potential customers might still have after reading the above content. Essentially, you surface those concerns and answer them proactively. This helps prevent the user from leaving the page to seek answers elsewhere (or worse, abandoning due to uncertainty). Objectives: Remove the last roadblocks to conversion by addressing questions of cost, trust, fit, and process. Build additional trust and clarity. A well-crafted FAQ can also reinforce some selling points under the guise of answering questions. By the end of this section, the visitor should have no major lingering questions that would hold them back from clicking the CTA. They should feel “Okay, I have all the info I need and I feel comfortable proceeding.” Best Practices & Content:
Format: Use a clear Q&A format. You can style it like:
Q: [Concern in the customer’s voice]?
A: [Reassuring answer that resolves the concern].
Common practice is to bold the question and have the answer in normal text, or use an accordion component where questions can be clicked to reveal answers (though be cautious with accordions on landing pages; visible Q&A is often better for scanning unless space is an issue).
Common Objections to Address: Think from the perspective of a skeptical business owner or entrepreneur. What might stop them from converting? Here are likely ones for Arzani’s scenario:
“Is the valuation really free? What’s the catch?” – People may suspect that “free valuation” could lead to a sales pitch or requires a commitment. The answer should reassure: Yes, it’s completely free and no-obligation. We offer it as a value-added first step. You can use your valuation whether or not you continue with our platform. Emphasize there’s no hidden fee or requirement to list. This builds trust by showing Arzani is confident in providing upfront value.
“How accurate are these AI valuations? Can I trust them?” – Since AI valuation is a key feature, address its credibility. Answer with facts from Arzani’s data: Our AI valuation tool has been tested on thousands of past sales and is 85-90% accurate compared to final sale prices​
arzani.co.uk
. It considers over 100 factors (industry, financials, trends) to give you a data-backed estimate. While no valuation can predict a sale price with 100% certainty, our system is continually learning and has a track record of reliability. For complete confidence, we recommend providing detailed data – the more info, the more accurate the valuation​
arzani.co.uk
. You might also mention that Arzani can supplement AI with expert review if applicable (e.g., “Our team reviews the AI output to ensure it aligns with market reality.”).
“What if I’m not ready to sell yet? Can I still use Arzani?” – Some visitors might be just exploring, not ready to pull the trigger. Answer: Absolutely. You can use Arzani even if you’re in the research phase. In fact, we offer a Basic (free) plan for market research​
arzani.co.uk
 – you can get a valuation, browse listings, and access industry trends without listing your business or committing to anything. This is perfect for owners who are a year or two away from selling but want to prepare, or for buyers scanning the market. When you’re ready, Arzani will be here to smoothly transition you into the actual transaction. This assures that Arzani is valuable even early on and that there’s no pressure.
“How do you ensure confidentiality? I don’t want competitors or employees to know I’m selling.” – Privacy is huge in business sales. Answer: We understand the need for discretion. With Arzani, you control what information is public. You can list your business anonymously (no identifying details in public) and only reveal sensitive info (like your company name or financials) to vetted buyers under NDA. All user data is encrypted and we never share your personal details without permission​
arzani.co.uk
. Our platform also allows private communication channels between you and interested buyers, so you can explore offers confidentially. If possible, mention any specific feature like “private listing option” or similar.
“What does it cost to use Arzani beyond the free valuation?” – If pricing isn’t discussed elsewhere, someone will wonder. If Arzani’s revenue model is subscription or success fee or whatever, be upfront. Perhaps: Arzani’s core marketplace is free to join and explore. The free valuation is, of course, free. If you decide to list your business, we offer [pricing model: e.g., a simple subscription or a small success fee]. For example, [explain pricing plans briefly, or say “our Standard listing plan is free, and we have premium services available – see our Pricing page for details”]. You might not want to delve deep into pricing on a landing page meant to capture leads, but at least give reassurance that it’s not a huge hidden cost. Many B2B SaaS give a high-level statement like “Affordable plans for businesses of all sizes” or “No commission – just a flat listing fee after valuation” etc., to set expectations. Since one of Rightbiz’s selling points is 0% commission, if Arzani also has a no-commission model, absolutely call that out. Conversely, if Arzani does charge commission, emphasize the value (e.g., “competitive commission only upon success, with no upfront cost”).
“How is Arzani different from Rightbiz or other marketplaces/brokers?” – This is a direct comparison question. The answer can summarize 2-3 key differentiators in a friendly way: Traditional marketplaces are essentially bulletin boards – they list businesses but don’t actively help you succeed. Arzani is different: we guide you end-to-end with AI analytics and expert support. Compared to Rightbiz or others, Arzani provides a free precise valuation, personalized buyer matching, and a faster sales process. We’re more than a listing site – we’re a smart platform to maximize your outcome. And unlike hiring a broker (who might charge 8-10% commission), Arzani lets you handle the sale with powerful tools at a fraction of the cost. This kind of answer positions Arzani as a modern, value-rich alternative without directly bashing the competitor. It’s factual and benefit-oriented, which is persuasive.
“How long does it take to sell a business on Arzani?” – Many will wonder about timeline. Answer: It varies by business, but Arzani’s data shows well-priced listings with complete info often attract offers within weeks. On average, Arzani listings close in 2-6 months, which is considerably faster than the 6-12+ month industry average​
arzani.co.uk
. Our AI helps optimize your pricing and listing details to speed up the process while maintaining value. This both sets realistic expectations and uses Arzani’s advantage of being faster​
arzani.co.uk
 as a selling point.
“Is Arzani suitable for [my type/size of business]?” – If the marketplace has a niche (SMBs), someone might ask if their business is too small, too large, or not the right industry. Answer: Arzani is designed for small to medium-sized businesses across a wide range of industries – from local retail shops to online startups. Whether your business is valued at £50k or £5M, our platform scales to support you. We categorize listings by industry and size, and our buyer network is diverse. If you’re ever unsure, our team can advise on the best approach for your specific business. In short, if you’re an SMB in the UK, Arzani is built for you. (If there are exclusions, note them, but presumably Arzani focuses on SMB which covers a lot.)
“What happens after I get my free valuation?” – Explain the user journey to relieve uncertainty: After your valuation, you’ll receive a detailed report via email. You’ll also have the option to speak with an Arzani advisor (free consultation) to discuss the valuation and next steps. If you’re ready to proceed, you can create a listing on our marketplace (our system will carry over your data to make it easy). If not, no problem – the valuation is yours to keep, and you can come back whenever you’re ready. There’s no pressure or automatic listing. This sets expectations and invites them to engage further without fear.
Prioritize Top Questions: You don’t need to include every one of these, but definitely cover the biggies: cost, trust/accuracy, confidentiality, and what the process looks like. 4-6 well-chosen Q&As are usually sufficient. From a CRO standpoint, it’s better to explicitly answer these than to leave them guessing, because unanswered questions = friction. ConversionXL’s Peep Laja often emphasizes that addressing anxiety and information gaps is crucial to conversion – an FAQ is a great tool for that.
Tone in Answers: The answers should be reassuring, straightforward, and confidence-inspiring. If possible, anchor your answers in evidence or specifics (as shown above: citing accuracy percentages, mentioning GDPR compliance, etc. lends credibility). Avoid vague reassurances like “Don’t worry, it’s all good” – instead, give concrete reasons not to worry. Also, keep answers concise; if something requires a long explanation, you might consider if that content should be baked earlier on the page or if it’s a sign the concept needs simplifying. For a landing page, each answer might be 2-4 sentences long (some of the examples above are a bit lengthy; they could be trimmed for brevity).
Design Consideration: As mentioned, FAQs can be accordion-style to save space (click to expand answers). This can make the page appear shorter and allows users to pick the questions they care about. However, if you have room, showing the questions and answers outright can be beneficial for scanning – a user might not bother clicking if they’re only mildly curious, and then miss an answer that would have convinced them. A compromise approach is to show a short list of Q’s, and clicking slides down the page to an answer or pops it out. If using accordions, ensure the UI is obvious and mobile-friendly (larger tap targets).
After reading the Objection Handling/FAQ, a prospect should feel that nothing critical has been left unanswered. They should sense transparency and thoroughness – important trust factors. With objections out of the way, all that’s left is to strongly prompt them to take action.
Final CTA Section
What it is: The final CTA section is the concluding part of the landing page, typically where you present one more compelling call-to-action for the visitor to convert (in this case, to get their free valuation). It often includes a short summary or tagline reinforcing the offer, plus the CTA button or form. Think of it as the “last pitch” and invitation. Objectives: Provide a clear, irresistible last push to get the user to take the next step now. Summarize or re-emphasize the core value briefly, maybe add a small incentive or urgency, and make it extremely easy to act (with a big CTA). By the end of this section, ideally the visitor clicks the button or begins filling the form – conversion accomplished. Best Practices & Content:
Concise Value Reiteration: Include a short sentence or two that encapsulates the key benefit of converting. For example: “Ready to see what your business could be worth? Don’t leave money on the table – get a precise, AI-powered valuation in minutes.” This reminds them of why they should care about this CTA (the benefit: knowing their value, not missing out on money). Another approach: “Take the first step toward a successful business sale with a FREE valuation from Arzani.” Use strong, positive language that aligns with their goal (successful sale, confident decision, growth, etc.). If possible, tie in an emotional angle: “Gain clarity and confidence for your next move.”
CTA Button (and/or form): Present the primary CTA again, prominently. If you only had a button in the hero, you might actually include a short form here to reduce a step (e.g., Name + Email + “Get My Free Valuation” button). Or vice versa – if you had a form on top, you could simply do a large button here that scrolls back up to the form or triggers a popup. The Balsamiq guide suggests repeating the same call to action at the bottom paired with a closing headline​
balsamiq.com
, which is exactly what we’re doing. The button text should be the same action phrase as before for consistency (e.g., “Get My Free Valuation”). Maintain the same color and style as earlier CTAs so it’s recognized as the same action. Ensure it’s large enough to tap on mobile and surrounded by whitespace. If you choose to embed a form here, make it as short as possible (perhaps even just an email address field with a “Get Started” button, then you can collect more info in the next step or follow-up).
Secondary Reinforcement Elements: Next to the CTA or under it, you can add very brief trust boosters:
A small lock icon with “Your information is private and secure.” (This reassures as they’re about to submit info).
Or a note like “No credit card required, no obligations” to reduce perceived commitment.
If you have a high count of people who have taken the action, something like “Join 200+ business owners who have discovered their valuation with Arzani.” This creates FOMO/consensus gently.
Keep these secondary texts small so they don’t distract, but visible enough to be noticed subconsciously.
Urgency or Scarcity (if ethical): If there is any time-bound aspect to the offer, mention it. For example, if the free valuation is a limited-time promotion (assuming it is or could be), say “(Limited time offer – free valuations available through [Month]!)” near the CTA. This can nudge procrastinators. If not time-limited, you can still instill urgency by context: “Market conditions are always changing – get your up-to-date valuation now.” This implies do it sooner rather than later because maybe the value could shift. However, maintain honesty; do not fabricate urgency if it’s not real. Alternatively, you could say something like “Get started today and be ahead of 90% of sellers who wait too long.” But simpler is better: maybe a subtle “now” or “today” in the CTA line is enough (e.g., “Get your free valuation now” suggests urgency without a hard deadline).
Wrap-up Tone: The tone should be encouraging and positive. You want to leave them feeling empowered: “You’ve seen how Arzani can transform the way you buy or sell a business. The next step is easy and free – claim your valuation and let data guide your decisions.” Keep it short though; at this point, you don’t want to introduce new info, just motivate action on what’s already been said.
Avoid introducing new links or distractions: At the bottom, aside from perhaps a privacy policy link (in small text), do not add extra buttons like “Learn more” or anything that could take them away. The only thing to click should be the CTA or maybe FAQ toggles if those exist near. One CTA, one focus​
balsamiq.com
. If you have a site footer with other nav links, consider omitting it or keeping it minimal (just terms/privacy). A landing page can have an extremely minimal footer to avoid off-ramps.
Mobile considerations: Often on mobile, after scrolling through content, a user may need to scroll back up to find the CTA. That’s why repeating it at bottom is vital – it catches those who made it through the content. Also, some designs implement a sticky footer bar on mobile with the CTA (“Free Valuation”) always visible. That’s an advanced technique that can boost conversion by removing the need to scroll to find the CTA. If you have dev capacity to implement that, it’s worth testing (just ensure it’s not too intrusive). Otherwise, the bottom CTA does the job when they reach the end.
Example Final Section: Imagine the bottom of the page looking like this:
Ready to Maximize Your Business’s Value?
Don’t leave the future of your business to guesswork. Take advantage of Arzani’s free AI-driven valuation and expert insights today to plan your next move with confidence.
【CTA Button: Get My Free Valuation】
It’s fast, free, and 100% confidential.
This setup gives a final rallying cry (maximize your value, don’t rely on guesswork), a reiteration of the free offer, and a trust line about being confidential. The CTA button is right there to tap. Once the user clicks this CTA, they either submit the form or go to a dedicated sign-up/valuation page. Make sure that subsequent step is also optimized – e.g., a short form, a clear next step indicator, and a thank-you/confirmation with what happens next (if beyond the scope of this page, at least plan for it). In summary, the final CTA section should leave no ambiguity about what the user should do. It caps off the persuasive journey with a clear invitation. At this point, we’ve guided the user through understanding why they need this, how Arzani helps, built trust, answered questions, and given every incentive to act. All that’s left is their click.
With the section-by-section breakdown covered, you have a blueprint for content. But crafting the copy and layout is just part of the equation. Next, we’ll discuss some copywriting frameworks that underpin this structure, as well as design and UX principles (visual hierarchy, mobile design, etc.) to ensure the page not only reads well but also looks and functions optimally for conversion.
Copywriting Frameworks and Formulas
Creating persuasive landing page copy is made easier by leveraging proven copywriting frameworks. These frameworks are formulas or structures that tap into how people process information and make decisions. For Arzani’s landing page, using these will ensure our messaging is coherent, compelling, and conversion-focused. Here are key frameworks and how they apply:
AIDA (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action): This classic formula maps perfectly to a landing page structure​
unbounce.com
​
unbounce.com
.
Attention: The hero section’s headline and imagery grab attention (e.g., bold statement about AI valuations).
Interest: The problem/agitation section and the start of the solution section build interest by talking about issues the audience cares about and hinting at solutions. We maintain interest with subheads and engaging copy (like storytelling about a seller’s journey).
Desire: The solution/benefits, features, and social proof sections cultivate desire. We show the outcomes and advantages (fast sales, accurate pricing, etc.) and have testimonials that make the prospect want those results for themselves. This is where we translate product features into personal benefits that the prospect desires (more money, less stress, confidence).
Action: Finally, the CTA sections (both top and bottom) prompt action, with clear instructions to “Get a free valuation.” The action is backed by all the previous steps making sense and appealing. In practice, we’ve structured the page in an AIDA-like flow (with some elements like FAQs inserted to reinforce Desire and nudge Action by removing doubt). AIDA is effective because it mirrors the natural psychological progression of a buyer.
PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solution): We used this heavily in the content. It’s one of Joanna Wiebe’s favored formulas for landing pages and emails because it immediately resonates with the audience’s pain before offering a fix.
Problem: We explicitly call out the problems (e.g., “Unsure of your business’s value?” or “Selling a business is complicated and slow.”).
Agitate: We then amplify that by describing consequences or frustrations (e.g., “You could be undervaluing by thousands, or waiting forever for the right buyer…”).
Solution: We introduce Arzani as the solution, showing how it addresses each aspect of the problem (AI valuations to remove guesswork, marketplace to find buyers, etc.). We structured the landing page with a problem/agitation section followed by the solution section, which is essentially applying PAS. This formula is great for hooking readers because it shows empathy (you get their problem) and then provides relief (your solution). It’s more emotionally driven than AIDA’s initial stages, which is often perfect for B2B leads who may be feeling pain points acutely (like an owner anxious about selling). Tip: When writing in PAS, really use the language the customer uses when thinking about their problem. For example, an owner might say “I don’t even know where to start to sell my business.” We might put that phrasing in the copy or headline to reflect their inner dialogue (this is conversion copywriting 101 – echoing the “voice of the customer”). As Unbounce’s test showed, sometimes even a slightly clever or informal tone that matches the customer’s voice can outperform a bland but clear one​
unbounce.com
. E.g., a headline like “Selling your business sucks… we’re here to change that” could grab attention by speaking plainly. We’d test such tone, but it’s an example of matching their feelings (if appropriate for the professional tone we want).
The 4 Ps (Promise, Picture, Proof, Push): This is another formula (often used in sales letters) which we implicitly cover:
Promise: The headline/subheadline make a promise (e.g., free valuation, faster sale).
Picture: The copy then paints a picture of life with the solution (business sold easily, etc.).
Proof: Social proof and data give proof that the promise is real (testimonials, stats).
Push: The final CTA and urgency push them to act now. We’ve integrated these elements throughout. For instance, promise in hero, proof in testimonials, push in final CTA.
FAB (Features-Advantages-Benefits): When writing about features (like we did in the feature/benefit section), a good micro-framework is to go from Feature -> Advantage -> Benefit. For example: Feature: “AI valuation algorithm” -> Advantage: “processes 100+ data points in seconds” -> Benefit: “you get an accurate valuation instantly, without tedious calculations or waiting.” In the copy we provided, we often merged advantage and benefit by saying what it does and why that’s good. Keeping FAB in mind ensures that for every feature (AI, matching, etc.), we explicitly state the benefit (so what?). This prevents the content from becoming too product-centric and keeps it customer-centric. If you find any piece of copy that is just describing a tool or feature, ask “So what for the user?” and add that. For example, “Real-time market data feed” (feature) – so what? – “so you always have the latest info on buyer demand and can time your sale optimally” (benefit).
Storytelling & Narrative Arc: As referenced in the Leadfeeder guide​
leadfeeder.com
, telling a story can be incredibly effective. We didn’t write a full case study narrative in our example (other than perhaps in a testimonial or scenario), but we could weave a simple narrative: The before state (struggling seller), the after state (successful sale via Arzani), and Arzani as the bridge between them. This is sometimes called Before-After-Bridge: Before (describe the customer’s world before, with pain) -> After (imagine how great it is after the problem is solved) -> Bridge (present your solution as the way to get from before to after). For instance, “Before Arzani: you’re overwhelmed and unsure. After Arzani: you’ve sold your business smoothly for a great price. Bridge: Arzani’s AI and team guide you every step of the way.” We implicitly used this concept: painting the painful before, then the improved after with Arzani. It’s a powerful persuasive structure because it helps the prospect visualize success.
Clarity over Cleverness (with a caveat): A commonly cited rule (Oli Gardner, Peep Laja, etc.) is “Clarity trumps cleverness” in conversion copy​
unbounce.com
. We should adhere to clarity – especially since this is a professional B2B context, we don’t want to confuse with cutesy slogans that don’t communicate value. That said, as the Unbounce test showed, if a clever phrase actually resonates better with the audience’s internal monologue, it can win​
unbounce.com
. For example, something like “The smartest way to sell your business” vs. a more playful “Finally, a way to sell your business that doesn’t drive you crazy.” The latter is a bit more informal but might connect emotionally. We can incorporate mild cleverness or a human touch as long as the core message remains clear. The key is testing (as they did with clear vs clever and found clever won in that case because it felt more relatable​
unbounce.com
). In practice, start with a clear baseline and consider testing more personality if appropriate.
Use of Second Person (“You”) and Command Verbs: Good conversion copy speaks directly to the reader. We predominantly use “you” (and “your”) in the copy, which makes it feel like we’re addressing their personal situation, rather than talking abstractly. E.g., “Get your free valuation” (instead of “Get a free valuation for businesses”). Also, using command verbs in CTA (“Get”, “Discover”, “Start”) creates a sense of immediacy and agency. We avoid passive or weak language around the CTA. Instead of “You can request a free valuation” (too passive), we say “Get your free valuation” (active and direct).
Keep Paragraphs and Sentences Digestible: We aim for a conversational yet authoritative tone. That often means varying sentence length but generally keeping them on the shorter side for easy consumption. We broke content into short paragraphs (as we should in final formatting, 2-4 sentences ideally each) to avoid walls of text. In the outline above, we provided a lot of content, but in the actual page design, it will be chunked under headings, bullets, etc., so it won’t feel like reading an essay. The content should flow logically – each section heading gives context to the text that follows, making it easy for someone skimming to still get the gist.
Address the Reader’s Stage of Awareness: A concept from copywriting expert Eugene Schwartz is the spectrum of customer awareness. Some readers might be completely unaware (they don’t even know they have a problem), some are problem-aware, some solution-aware, some product-aware. Given someone who lands on Arzani’s page likely clicked an ad or search result about “sell my business” or “business valuation,” they are at least problem-aware (they know they want to sell or need a valuation) and possibly solution-aware (they may know solutions exist like brokers or marketplaces). We craft the copy accordingly:
We don’t have to convince them that selling a business can be beneficial (they’re already looking into it), but we do need to convince them that Arzani’s way is the best solution (so they might not be product-aware about Arzani specifically).
Thus, we focus on differentiators and benefits of our solution over the status quo. If someone is more unaware, the problem-agitation parts educate them on why they need a solution in the first place (covering that base too).
The frameworks PAS and AIDA inherently handle awareness by starting with problem (for those not even sure of solution yet) and then moving to solution.
Use of Power Words and Persuasive Language: Certain words carry persuasive weight – like “free”, “proven”, “exclusive”, “guaranteed”, “instantly”, “secure”, etc. We have already used some (“free valuation”, “advanced analytics”, “comprehensive”, “streamlined”, “trusted by”, “ensure”, etc.). In B2B, words that convey safety, speed, ease, and value are particularly effective. But avoid hype or overuse of superlatives (don’t say “the best thing ever!” – say it in a way that can be believed, e.g., “designed to be faster and smarter than traditional methods” – it’s a claim but backed by reason). Also avoid vague buzzwords; instead of “revolutionary synergy platform”, be concrete (“AI-powered business marketplace” is understandable).
Make the Offer Clear: The primary offer here is “Free valuation”. We should ensure this stands out. It’s mentioned in headline, CTA, etc. Another formula – not exactly a copy framework but a principle – is "value proposition = headline + subhead + 3 bullets." We effectively did that in the hero. The idea is that someone should grasp the offer and value prop in about 5 seconds (which is what the above structure provides). Copyhackers stresses that the benefit of the offer must be clear​
copyhackers.com
. On our page, the benefit of clicking (getting a free valuation => clarity on your business’s worth + step toward selling at max value) is emphasized. We can even label the CTA as “Get My Free Valuation Report” if we want to highlight they’ll get a deliverable (the word “report” might increase perceived value of what they receive).
Joanna Wiebe’s Technique – “So what? Prove it.”: A trick from Copyhackers is to go through your copy and for each claim, ask “So what?” (to ensure you’ve given a benefit) and “Can I prove it?” (to ensure credibility). We have been doing that by adding stats from Arzani and testimonials. For example, we say “sell 37% faster” – that’s a proof element with a number. When we say “maximize your sale price,” we back it with “accurate market analysis helps you get the highest possible price” and perhaps a stat or testimonial confirming that. This combination of benefit + proof is persuasive. Peep Laja often emphasizes the need for credible specifics: general platitudes don’t convert as well as concrete claims and evidence.
Cialdini’s Persuasion Principles in Copy: We naturally incorporated some:
Reciprocity: We’re giving a free valuation – this is like a gift which can invoke a sense of reciprocity (they may feel more inclined to engage or list with us after receiving value for free).
Social Proof: We dedicated a section to testimonials and logos – clearly leveraging this principle.
Authority: Citing that Arzani uses advanced AI, has experts, possibly mentioning partnerships or compliance, all build authority. Even the polished design and copy will lend authority.
Scarcity: If we can truthfully add a scarcity element (limited time free, limited spots), that could boost action. If not, we use soft urgency as discussed.
Consistency/Commitment: By getting them to take a small action (free valuation) they begin a journey that might lead to listing. This micro-commitment can make them more likely to follow through (consistency principle – once they identify as someone interested in selling, they’ll act in line with that identity).
Liking: We try to make the tone personable and empathetic, so they feel Arzani understands them. If Arzani has a founder story or mission about “helping small business owners succeed”, sometimes including a human element like that can increase liking (people prefer to do business with those they like or feel share their values). Even just using testimonials from relatable business owners fosters liking.
Templates and Swipes: The structure we created can be seen as a template. To implement immediately, one could fill in each section with the specifics of Arzani. We gave a lot of those specifics as examples drawn from Arzani’s site (AI, etc.). A helpful tip is to swipe messaging from competitors where they do well. For instance, Rightbiz highlights “Maximised Business Value”, “Dynamic Marketing Exposure”, etc.​
rightbiz.co.uk
 – Arzani can use similar points but amp them up (with AI angle). We basically did that in features. Using competitor messaging as a starting point (not copying, but as inspiration) ensures you cover what the market expects plus differentiate. Another template is to use headline formulas like:
“How to [achieve desired outcome] without [pain].” E.g., “How to sell your business fast without paying hefty commissions.” That could be a subheader or ad copy leading to the page.
“Get [Benefit] in [Short Time] – [CTA].” E.g., “Get an accurate business valuation in 5 minutes – free.” Short and enticing.
We can craft multiple versions and test (A/B test headlines or subheads).
Consistent Messaging and Formula Throughline: We should ensure that the tone and promises made in any ads that lead here align with the landing page (for message match). If the ad says “Free Business Valuation in 24 hours,” the landing page should mention that timeframe or at least not contradict it. Also, maintain consistency in terms of the framework – if an ad already agitated a problem, the landing can continue from that. If the traffic is coming cold, the landing might have to do more of the problem setup itself.
In summary, by applying AIDA to structure the page, PAS to hook the audience, and sprinkling in techniques like FAB and social proof, we create a narrative that is both logical and emotionally compelling. Every piece of copy has a job – whether to grab attention, build interest, stoke desire, or prompt action. Using these frameworks ensures no piece is wasted and the reader is guided step by step toward converting. Finally, good copywriting goes hand-in-hand with good design. So next, let’s cover the visual and design principles (visual hierarchy, layout, mobile optimization, etc.) that will elevate this copy and make the page as user-friendly and conversion-friendly as possible.
Visual Hierarchy and Design Principles
Great copy is only effective if it’s presented in a clear, visually appealing way. Visual hierarchy is about guiding the user’s eyes to the most important elements first, and ensuring the page is not overwhelming. We want Arzani’s landing page to look modern, professional, and easy to digest at a glance. Below are key design principles and how to implement them:
Clear Hierarchy of Text: Establish a distinct difference between headlines, subheadings, body text, and buttons. The main headline (H1) should
Visual Hierarchy and Design Principles
A well-designed landing page uses visual hierarchy to guide visitors to key information in the right order. Visual hierarchy means making the most important elements the most prominent (via size, color, placement), so the page communicates clearly even to someone skimming. Here’s how to apply core design principles for Arzani’s page:
Hierarchy of Text and Elements: Establish a clear typographic hierarchy. The main headline should be the largest text on the page – it immediately draws the ey​
balsamiq.com
】. Subheadings (like section titles “The Solution” or “Why Arzani”) should be smaller than the main headline but larger than body text. Use consistent fonts (e.g., a clean sans-serif for a modern look) and brand colors. Important messages (like the CTA text “Get a free valuation”) can be accented with a bold color or button. Supporting text should be smaller and secondary. By sizing and styling text in tiers, you ensure a visitor’s eye catches the headline first, then subheader, then body copy in order of importance.
Whitespace and Clean Layout: Don’t fear empty space – whitespace is your friend. Crowding elements makes a page feel overwhelming. Adequate spacing around sections and around the CTA button makes each component stand ou​
balsamiq.com
】. For example, ensure there’s padding between the hero text and the next section, and clear separation between distinct sections (problem, solution, etc.). Whitespace guides the eye by isolating groups of content. As Balsamiq’s example showed, adding space around elements can instantly remove a feeling of clutter and make the CTA more visually prominen​
balsamiq.com
】. Aim for a clean, uncluttered layout where each section (hero, benefits, proof, etc.) is visually distinct, perhaps by alternating background colors or using divider lines. A common practice is to use a subtle background color change or graphic element to signal a new section – e.g., hero on white, then a light grey background for the problem section, white again for solution, etc. This creates a rhythm and helps users instinctively know when they’ve moved to a new topi​
balsamiq.com
】.
F-Pattern and Flow: Users often scan in an “F” or “Z” pattern on desktop – meaning they look across the top, then down a bit, then across, and so on. Ensure your top horizontal (the hero) has the crucial info (which we do: headline, CTA). As they scroll, align important headings to the left (since eyes scan down the left side). We’ve structured content with clear left-aligned headings and short paragraphs/bullets, which fits these reading patterns. On mobile, users scroll down in a linear fashion, so center-align key elements and use short blocks of text. In general, break up text with visuals or bullets so the page isn’t just a wall of text. Our design includes many bullets and short paragraphs, making it easy to scan.
Contrast and Color Use: Use color contrast to highlight the CTA and key points. Arzani’s brand colors (perhaps blues or other corporate tones) can be used for headlines or accents, but choose one high-contrast color for the CTA buttons (for instance, if the site is mostly blue/grey, maybe the CTA is an orange or green – something that pops). The CTA button should stand out against the background and other element​
balsamiq.com
】. Also ensure text contrast is high – dark text on a light background (or vice versa) so it’s very readable (accessibility is important, e.g., meet WCAG contrast ratios). Use color sparingly for emphasis: perhaps one accent color for all buttons and highlights, while keeping the rest of the palette neutral or brand-aligned. Too many colors can be visually confusing; consistency here builds recognition (e.g., if all CTA buttons are Arzani green, users learn that color = actionable).
Directional Cues: Subtle visual cues can direct attention. For example, an arrow icon or downward chevron at the end of the hero could signal “scroll for more”, guiding users to continu​
balsamiq.com
】. If you use an image of a person in the hero, you can have them looking toward the CTA/button – studies show people follow line of sight, so this can nudge visitors to look at the form or button. In the design, if we include illustrations, we might angle them or use shapes that lead the eye toward the content (e.g., a diagonal background line pointing toward the headline). Balsamiq’s own landing page uses a subtle downward arrow shape in design to encourage scrollin​
balsamiq.com
】. We can mimic such techniques: for instance, a slight diagonal background that “points” to the next section or a contrast band that draws the eye down.
Images and Graphics with Purpose: Every image on the page should support the message (not just decorate). For instance, use icons in the benefits section to reinforce each point (a shield icon for security, a clock for faster sales, etc.), which helps visual learners grasp the meaning quickly. If using photos (like for testimonials), ensure they are high quality and professional. Avoid generic stock photos; if you need a generic image (say for the hero background), choose something subtle and relevant (like an abstract image of data, or an office scene that isn’t cheesy). Keep imagery consistent in style and tone. If Arzani uses illustrations on the website, carry that style here for brand consistency. Also, be mindful of image file sizes – compress images for web so the page loads fast (speed is part of UX). A fast-loading page keeps users from bouncing; Google’s data shows even a 1-2 second delay can hurt conversions.
No Visual Clutter: Resist the temptation to overdesign. One primary image or graphic per section is usually enough. For example, in the hero maybe one illustration, in the solution section maybe an accompanying image of the dashboard, etc. Lots of competing visuals can distract from the CTA. Maintain a consistent alignment and grid. Use bullet lists or icons to chunk information instead of long paragraphs – it’s visually cleaner and aligns content in a nice block. The design should communicate “professional and trustworthy”. That means clean lines, enough padding, and consistency (same font styles for similar elements, same button styles throughout). Consistency is a subtle but important part of visual hierarchy – if every section looked wildly different, the user might not realize they are parts of one story. We want each part distinct yet cohesive with the overall design language.
Responsive Layout (Grid System): Design using a responsive grid (e.g., 12-column grid for desktop that collapses to fewer columns on mobile). On desktop, you might have two-column arrangements (text on left, image on right, etc.), but on mobile these will stack vertically. Plan for that: ensure that when stacking, the content still makes sense order-wise (usually you want text to come before the image it’s referring to, so the user sees the explanation before/above the image on a phone). Test the hierarchy on both desktop and mobile. The most important info should ideally appear early on mobile too (so maybe you repeat the CTA or have a shorter summary high up on mobile if needed).
Highlighting Key Data or Quotes: If there’s a particularly compelling stat or testimonial snippet, consider using typographic emphasis to make it stand out. For example, a big quotation mark graphic and a few words in larger font to pull out a phrase like “sold in 3 months above asking price” from a testimonial can catch attention. Similarly, if you have a key stat (“37% faster sales”), you could display that in a large font as a visual element on its own. These act as focal points in the visual hierarchy and break up text-heavy sections. Just don’t overdo it – pick one or two such highlights.
Above-the-Fold Considerations: The area immediately visible (above the fold) on page load should contain the most crucial elements: headline, subhead, CTA, possibly a hero image, and maybe a very brief trust indicator (like “[★ ★ ★ ★ ★] Trusted by 500+ UK businesses” or a couple of client logos) to build instant credibility. We want a first-time visitor to get the value prop without any scrollin​
copyhackers.com
​
copyhackers.com
】. That said, don’t cram too much just for the sake of “the fold” – it’s okay if details are below, as long as the essential hook is visible. Modern users know to scroll, especially if the design makes it clear more content is below (hence an arrow or a cut-off part of an image can hint at more below).
Consistency with Brand and Professional Aesthetics: Because Arzani is a B2B platform dealing with financial transactions, the design should err on the side of professional, modern minimalism rather than overly playful or artistic. Use Arzani’s branding guidelines (colors, logo, typography) for trust and consistency. If Arzani has a logo and style from its main site, reflect that here (the landing page can omit navigation, but it should still look like it’s Arzani’s property). Elements like the footer (if any) should use the same style as the main site’s footer (but trimmed down as discussed). This consistency builds trust – visitors feel it’s a credible company’s page, not a random ad page.
Accessibility and Readability: Use at least medium-sized fonts (e.g., 16px+ for body text) to ensure readability on all screens. High contrast for text as mentioned. Also consider accessibility in design: use real text (not text in images) for everything important (so screen readers can read it). Add alt text to images (especially if, say, the hero image contains some information). Ensure the page can be navigated with keyboard (e.g., the form fields highlight clearly when tabbed). These may seem technical, but accessibility overlaps with good UX which overlaps with conversion – an accessible page is often a more user-friendly page for everyone.
Visual Emphasis on CTA: Since conversion is the goal, visually emphasize the CTA sections. For instance, the final CTA section might have a slightly different background or a prominent encapsulating design (like a colored box or a standout banner) to draw the ey​
balsamiq.com
】. Encapsulation is a known technique: putting the CTA in a box or distinct panel can increase its visibility. You can also include a subtle shadow or glow on the CTA button to make it “pop” off the page (while still looking clean). Ensure there’s nothing competing with that button (no other buttons of equal weight). Unbounce’s principle of “Attention-Driven Design” is relevant: for each page, ask if any element is drawing attention away from the main conversion goal; if yes, consider removing or downplaying it. We’ve already minimized distractions by removing nav, etc., but design-wise, keep secondary links (like privacy or FAQ toggles) visually small relative to the big orange (for example) CTA button.
In essence, the page design should lead a visitor through a visual story: a bold headline grabs them, informative sections flow one to the next, proof is clearly distinguished, and the call-to-action shines through. By using size, color, and spacing intelligently, we ensure the page isn’t just pretty – it’s purposeful. Each design element either increases understanding or drives action (or both). This synergy of design and copy will make the landing page far more effective.
Mobile-First and Responsive Design Best Practices
Given the prevalence of mobile users, Arzani’s landing page must be mobile-first and fully responsive. In fact, designing mobile-first (starting with the small screen in mind) often leads to a cleaner, more focused layout that benefits all devices. Here’s how to ensure a stellar mobile experience:
Mobile-First Approach: Begin by conceptualizing the page on a smartphone screen. Prioritize content so that only the most crucial elements appear first on mobile. This often forces beneficial simplification: shorter headlines, tighter copy, essential images only. Once the mobile layout is solid, you can enhance it for larger screens (adding columns or images side-by-side for desktop, for example). This approach ensures the page works great on mobile, rather than being a shrunk-down afterthought. As of 2025, Google indexes and ranks pages based on the mobile version primarily (mobile-first indexing​
leadfeeder.com
】, so a mobile-optimized page is not only good for users but for SEO too.
Responsive Layout and Breakpoints: Use responsive design techniques (CSS flexbox/grid, media queries) so the page adapts to various screen sizes: mobile, tablet, desktop, large monitors. Typically:
On mobile (small screens): Use a single-column layout. Everything should stack vertically. Images should scale to full width (with appropriate aspect ratio) so they’re not cut off or too small to see. Text blocks should have margins/padding so they don’t touch the screen edges (to avoid a cramped look and to prevent accidental edge taps).
On desktop (wider screens): You can utilize multi-column sections (e.g., text beside image) since there’s space. But also be mindful of very large screens – don’t stretch paragraphs too wide (long lines of text are hard to read). A max width container (like 1200px or so) centered on wide screens can keep readability high. That way, on a huge monitor, the content doesn’t become an 800px-long line; it stays in a nice contained width.
Navigation and Menus on Mobile: We’ve removed main navigation for conversion reason​
copyhackers.com
】. If any menu is present (say, a hamburger with minimal links like “Login” for existing users), ensure it’s accessible and doesn’t cover the CTA when opened. But ideally, we avoid any extra nav on this landing page to keep focus. So menu should be minimal or none. If the landing page is within a larger site with a fixed header normally, consider disabling that header for this page or using a simpler top bar (like just the logo and maybe a help icon).
Ensure Fast Load Times: Mobile users can have slower connections, so optimize performance:
Compress images (use modern formats like WebP/AVIF when possible; ensure images are appropriately sized – no 2000px wide image when it’s displayed at 400px on mobile).
Minimize heavy scripts. If using a video, use a lightweight thumbnail or ensure it’s not auto-playing on mobile (auto-playing video/audio can also annoy users and is data-heavy).
Use browser caching and possibly a CDN for assets. Fast load is crucial – as mentioned, a slow page frustrates users (leading to bounces) and hurts Google ranking​
leadfeeder.com
】. Tools like Google PageSpeed Insights or Lighthouse can be used to check mobile performance. Aim for green scores where possible.
Touchable Elements: Make sure all interactive elements are easy to tap with a finger:
Buttons should be sufficiently large (a minimum of ~44px height according to Apple’s guidelines, for example). The CTA buttons we have are likely large and centered, which is good.
Form fields must also be tappable and not too close to other links (to prevent mis-taps). Provide enough space between form input fields.
Use the correct input types on mobile – e.g., <input type="email"> for email (shows the “@” on the mobile keyboard), <input type="tel"> for phone (shows numeric keypad). This little UX detail reduces friction in form input on mobile.
If any links are present (like FAQ questions could be expandable), ensure they are big enough to tap and spaced apart.
Sticky CTAs on Mobile: Consider a sticky footer or header CTA on mobile. For instance, a small bar at the bottom of the screen with “Get your free valuation” that’s always visible as they scroll. This way, after scrolling through info, the user doesn’t have to scroll back up to click the CTA. They can tap the sticky bar which would jump to the form or trigger it. Many mobile-optimized landers use this to good effect (just ensure it’s not too large to become annoying, and that it doesn’t overlap important content). We should test this, but it’s a powerful tactic to increase conversions on mobile where scrolling is extensiv​
balsamiq.com
】. If implementing, keep it minimal: maybe just the text and an icon or button style, and use Arzani’s accent color to make it visible.
No Intrusive Pop-ups: On mobile especially, avoid any pop-up or interstitial that covers content (e.g., “Subscribe to newsletter” modals, etc.). Not only do these hurt UX, but Google penalizes mobile pages that show intrusive interstitials. Our landing page likely won’t have any by design, since the goal is conversion (perhaps a thank-you modal after conversion, which is fine). If you ever consider using exit-intent popups or such, note that on mobile exit-intent is tricky and often translates to something intrusive. It’s generally safer to avoid them.
Optimize Font and Button Sizes: As mentioned, make sure text is large enough on mobile. Also consider line-height (spacing between lines) – slightly larger line-height (say 1.5em) improves readability of paragraphs on small screens. Buttons and form inputs should use a legible font size too. Often a problem on mobile is some desktop styles make text tiny on mobile; to counteract that, using relative fonts (like using viewport width units or percentages) can help scale text appropriately. We want to avoid the need for the user to zoom in.
Testing on Real Devices: It’s vital to test the landing page on actual phones and tablets. Emulators in a browser are a start, but real devices can reveal issues (like an element that is off-screen or a fixed element that doesn’t behave correctly). Check both iOS and Android if possible, and multiple browsers (Chrome, Safari). Also test various screen sizes – e.g., older smaller phones vs newer big phones – to ensure the design adapts (the responsive breakpoints might need tweaking if something looks off at a certain size).
Mobile-Specific Adjustments: Sometimes you might hide or swap out certain elements on mobile to streamline the experience. For example, a large image that looks great on desktop might be too small to be useful on mobile or push important text too far down. You could choose to hide that image on mobile for a better flow, or use a simpler image. Ensure headings don’t occupy too many lines on a narrow screen – if a headline is long, you might use a slightly smaller font on mobile or shorten the copy for mobile via CSS (advanced, but sometimes done). The key is the core message remains the same and nothing essential is lost for mobile users. Everything we planned (headline, benefits, CTA, proof) should still be present on mobile, just arranged vertically.
Touch Gestures and Mobile Behavior: If using any carousels (like for testimonials or images), ensure they support swipe gestures on mobile – users should be able to swipe left/right to navigate, not just rely on tiny arrow buttons. Also consider disabling any hover effects for mobile (since hover doesn’t exist on touch screens) and making sure clickable areas are obvious (maybe add subtle underlines on text links on mobile if color alone might not indicate it’s a link). Basically, test that any interactive element works with taps/swipes.
By following these mobile-first best practices, the landing page will provide a smooth experience on small screens. Remember, many busy entrepreneurs might click an ad or email on their phone first. If the mobile experience is poor, they’ll drop off and we lose the lead. But if it’s seamless – fast, easy to read, easy to act – we capture their interest on the spot. Additionally, a great mobile page bolsters our SEO (as Google prioritizes mobile-friendly sites). Arzani will benefit from making a strong impression on mobile users, which in turn boosts overall conversion rates.
CTA Optimization Techniques
The Call to Action (CTA) is the conversion keystone of the landing page. We need to make it as compelling and frictionless as possible for visitors to click that “Get a free valuation” button. We’ve touched on CTA copy and design; here we’ll summarize and add techniques specifically to optimize the CTA for maximum conversions:
Singular, Prominent CTA: As emphasized, stick to one primary CTA action on the page – Get a free valuation. While we repeat the button in multiple places (top and bottom), it always does the same thing (initiates the valuation process​
balsamiq.com
】. This consistency avoids confusion. Every CTA instance should be highly visible: use a bright, contrasting color that isn’t heavily used elsewhere on the page (to draw the eye). Also, make sure the CTA button looks like a button – use a rectangular shape with perhaps slightly rounded corners, and a hover effect on desktop (e.g., a slight darken or shadow on hover) to signal interactivit​

】. On mobile, as mentioned, consider a sticky CTA that’s always at hand.
CTA Copy – Clarity and Value: The wording on the CTA should combine an action verb with a value proposition. “Get My Free Valuation” is effective because it’s action-oriented (“Get”), personalized (“My”), and highlights the value (“Free Valuation”). Using first-person (“My”) in CTA copy is a known technique that can increase clicks because it subconsciously makes the user envision the result as theirs (e.g., Copyhackers found first-person CTAs often perform well). We could test variants like “Get Your Free Valuation” vs “Get My Free Valuation” – but starting with first-person is a good bet. Also ensure it’s not too wordy – 2-5 words is ideal for button text. It should convey what happens next; avoid generic “Submit” or “Continue”, which are weak. “Get Free Valuation” tells them exactly what they’re getting by clicking.
Visual Emphasis and Isolation: Surround the CTA with whitespace or an encapsulating design to make it stand ou​
balsamiq.com
】. For example, in the hero, if the CTA is below the subheadline, make sure there’s sufficient padding around it so it doesn’t get lost. In the final section, we might put the CTA on its own line with a minimal text around. This isolation effect draws attention. Also, use an arrow icon or chevron on the button if appropriate (like “→” or a right-pointing arrow graphic after the text) to give a visual cue of forward movement. It’s not necessary, but sometimes can subtly increase click rates (it indicates “this will take you somewhere”).
Size and Placement: The CTA buttons should be big enough to notice easily. A good rule is that the main CTA should be one of the largest elements on the screen after the headline. It shouldn’t be so large that it looks obnoxious, but it should be larger than any secondary buttons (if we had any, which we don’t) or form fields. Placement wise, we have one CTA early (likely right below hero text or integrated into hero) and one at the end. Additionally, a CTA can be repeated after a persuasive section – for instance, after the benefits or after social proof, we could include a text link or another button (“Ready to get your valuation? Click here”) leading to the form. Balsamiq suggests you may include the button multiple times if the page is long, at logical break​

】. For Arzani’s page, two times (top and bottom) is probably sufficient, given it’s not extremely long-form. But ensure the bottom CTA is immediately visible when a user finishes reading; they shouldn’t have to scroll back up to ac​

】.
Microcopy to Reduce Anxiety: Near the CTA, include a brief note that eases concerns. We did this with phrases like “fast, free, and 100% confidential” under the button. Other effective microcopy could be: “No credit card needed,” “No obligations,” or “Takes less than 2 minutes.” These address fears that clicking will lead to a tedious or costly process. For example, if someone worries “Will I have to fill a huge form?”, seeing “takes 2 minutes” sets their mind at ease. Or if they worry “Is this really free?”, the word “free” on the button and a reiteration below cover that. Another example: “We’ll provide your valuation with no strings attached.” This kind of microcopy builds trust right at the point of conversion.
Urgency and Timing Cues: To prompt immediate action, you can introduce urgency in the CTA or surrounding text (but carefully). For instance, the CTA could say “Get My Free Valuation Now”. Adding “now” or “today” can psychologically nudge faster action. If Arzani ever decides to make the free valuation a limited-time offer, that could be potent: e.g., “Get My Free Valuation (Limited Offer)” or a countdown indicating “Offer ends in 5 days” (though that would need a dynamic component or at least to be managed so it’s truthful). Even without a literal deadline, you can create a sense of urgency by emphasizing opportunity cost: “Get My Free Valuation and seize the market” – not typical on a button, but maybe in surrounding text like “Don’t miss out on this month’s active buyers – know your value now.” In our context, a gentle urgency (“now”) is likely enough, since pressing too hard might seem gimmicky in B2B. We can also rely on FOMO by hints like “Join dozens of business owners who’ve already valued their business this week” near the CTA if that data is available.
Testing CTA Variations: Optimize the CTA through A/B testing (more on that later) – but a quick note: test things like button color, copy text, and even shape. For example, perhaps a green button vs. an orange button could yield a better result – it often depends on what draws the eye given the rest of the color scheme. The good news is that because our page will have a singular focus, any color that isn’t used elsewhere will naturally stand out. Arzani’s brand palette might dictate the best choice (e.g., if their logo is blue, a complementary color like orange might stand out). Many studies show that contrasting color is more critical than any one “magic” color (there’s no universally best CTA color, it’s context-dependent). The key is consistency: pick a CTA color and use it for all primary buttons so users know that’s the action color.
Avoiding Distractions at CTA Click: Make sure that when the user clicks the CTA, the experience is smooth. If the CTA is a button that jumps to a form section, ensure it actually scrolls or opens correctly. If it opens a sign-up modal, the modal should load quickly and have the form ready. If it goes to another page, that page must be laser-focused too (ideally, we’d keep it on one page or a modal to not lose them). Essentially, the CTA’s effect should be immediate and on-point. Also, disable any unnecessary links near CTAs (for example, sometimes people put social media share buttons on landing pages – don’t do that, it tempts users to leave the page; we haven’t included any such things).
Use of Trust Badges Near CTA: Another optimization is placing a small trust symbol near the CTA. For example, a padlock icon with “Secure & confidential” (we mentioned), or a BBB accreditation logo if applicable, or even something like “★ 4.9/5 TrustScore” from reviews if Arzani had that. These can reassure right at the decision point. We just have to keep them subtle and in service of the CTA, not competing with it visually.
CTA in Email Follow-ups: Slightly tangential, but if someone leaves without converting, Arzani might retarget or email them (if we captured email via partial form). The landing page CTA optimization also extends to those follow-ups – e.g., email subject lines like “Don’t forget your free valuation” and in the email, a big CTA button to return. This is more about funnel strategy, but worth noting that the same principles (clear, compelling CTA) apply in any re-engagement.
In summary, our CTA strategy is: make it obvious, make it appealing, make it easy. “Obvious” through standout design and isolation, “appealing” through compelling copy (“free valuation” is inherently appealing to our audience) and urgency, and “easy” through minimizing steps and assuring them it’s simple/quick. By refining these aspects and continually testing improvements (CTA text and design are among the easiest high-impact tests to run), we can steadily boost the conversion rate of the page.
Social Proof and Credibility Elements
Trust is a deciding factor in converting B2B leads. We’ve already incorporated social proof in our content; here we’ll focus on how to maximize its impact through placement and variety of credibility elements:
Diverse Forms of Social Proof: We should include at least two or more types of social proof on the pag​
balsamiq.com
】:
Testimonials/Reviews: We have customer quotes which are extremely persuasive because they tell a story of success. Make sure these testimonials are attributed with name, perhaps business name or location, and a photo if possible. A face next to a quote adds authenticity. If a user sees “Sold my cafe in 4 months thanks to Arzani’s valuation – highly recommend!” – Jane D., Cafe Owner (London) with Jane’s smiling face, it humanizes our service and builds trust. Consider using a slider if space is tight, but also know that many users might not scroll a carousel – so it might be better to show 2-3 testimonials all at once in a column or grid. Each testimonial should hit a different angle if possible (one about fast sale, one about good price, one about ease of process) to cover multiple concerns.
Logos of Clients/Partners: If Arzani has notable businesses that have been bought/sold through the platform, show their logos in a “Trusted by” section. Even if the businesses aren’t widely famous, the presence of logos implies “real companies use this.” For example, logos of a few small business brands or franchises will do. If no client logos, consider logos of media outlets or awards: e.g., if Arzani was mentioned in TechCrunch or The Telegraph, putting “As seen in [TechCrunch logo] [TechNation logo] etc.” can add huge credibility. Industry affiliations can also go here (like partner networks, or if Arzani is part of an incubator or has investors, their logos with a caption “Backed by…”). Logos work best typically in a horizontal row or grid, often in grayscale to blend with a professional tone, introduced by a line like “Trusted by businesses and organizations such as:​

】.
Statistics and Numbers: People trust numbers. If Arzani can claim something like “£X million in deals facilitated” or “1000+ valuations performed”, those big round numbers can impress. We can display these in a bold typographic style. For instance:
1,200+ free valuations delivered to UK business owners.
98% satisfaction rate among Arzani users (if we had survey data or NPS).
50+ businesses sold in the last year via Arzani.
These kind of metrics, if available, should be highlighted. If Arzani is new and numbers are small, we might skip this or focus on growth rate or unique value instead. But since the prompt suggests outperforming Rightbiz, presumably Arzani wants to project strength, so any positive metric helps. Even a small number can be framed positively: e.g., “Join dozens of savvy owners who’ve tried Arzani this month.” It implies momentum.
Awards/Badges: Display any award (e.g., “UK Business Marketplace of the Year 2025” if it existed) or badges like ISO certified, or rating badges (like if there was a Trustpilot or Capterra rating). For example, showing 5 stars and “Rated 4.8/5 by our users” is quick social proof. Or a badge like “Google for Startups Alumni” if applicable. These lend third-party validation – someone else vouches for Arzani. Leadfeeder suggests using awards or certifications to win trus​

】.
Security/Privacy Seals: While not social proof per se, things like a Norton Secured or GDPR compliant icon can increase trust (especially when users are about to input data). We can place a small lock icon with “GDPR Compliant” near the form submit, as mentioned. It signals that Arzani respects privacy and security – critical for a platform dealing with confidential business info.
Placement of Social Proof: We integrated testimonials in a dedicated section after the solution. That’s good, but also consider sprinkling micro-proof elsewhere:
Perhaps place a short testimonial blurb or a star-rating right under the hero as an immediate trust signal. For example, below the CTA in hero, a small text: “★ ★ ★ ★ ★ Rated 5/5 by business owners like you” (if true) or a rotating one-line testimonial (“‘Arzani made selling my business easy’ – [Name]”). This way, even those who don’t scroll much see a form of social proof right away.
We have a main social proof section with multiple testimonials and logos – that’s great to reinforce mid-page.
Near the final CTA, we could echo a tiny proof element again (like “Join others who have succeeded – 50 businesses sold this year!” near the bottom CTA). That final nudge can reassure right before clicking.
Authenticity and Specificity: The more specific the social proof, the more credible. A testimonial saying “Great service!” is far weaker than one that says “With Arzani, we got 3 offers within a month and sold above asking. I saved £10k by not using a broke​
rightbiz.co.uk
】.” The latter has detail (3 offers, 1 month, £10k saved). Encourage testimonials that mention concrete results or measurable outcomes, as these are convincin​

】. Even a quote like “...their careful risk assessments helped me make an informed decision​
arzani.co.uk
】 from the Arzani site’s testimonial is nice and specific to buying decisions. Use such specifics from any existing user feedback (the content we saw in Arzani’s FAQ/testimonials can be repurposed as quotes with permission).
Credibility through Content and Tone: It’s not just explicit social proof that builds credibility – the overall tone and quality of content do as well. Our copy’s professional tone, correct grammar, and helpful information all contribute to the impression that Arzani is a legitimate, expert company. Sloppy copy or design can erode trust. Also, being transparent in the FAQ (like admitting “accuracy ~90%” rather than claiming 100%) ironically increases credibility because it shows honesty. Peep Laja often notes that clarity and honesty beat hype in B2B. So all our credibility elements should feel genuine. If Arzani is new and doesn’t have a lot of customers, it’s better to have one or two real, solid testimonials than five fake-sounding generic ones. Quality over quantity for trust elements.
Leverage Experts and Leadership: Another form of credibility is expert authority. For instance, if Arzani’s founder or team includes notable experts (like “Ex-investment banker” or “Valuation expert with 20 years experience”), that could be subtly mentioned. Perhaps an “About us” blurb or even a quote from the founder: “Our mission is to empower small business owners with AI insights that were once only available to big corporations,” – [Name], Founder of Arzani. This isn’t exactly social proof, but it adds a human face and authority voice. A small photo of the founder with a quote can personalize the brand. However, use this only if it strengthens trust (if the founder has relevant creds or a compelling vision). It shouldn’t distract from the main flow, so maybe as a sidebar or within the FAQ as an answer (“Who are we? We’re a team of X, Y, Z...” briefly).
Case Studies: If time and space permit, a mini-case study could be a powerful credibility booster. It combines story + proof. For example, a short paragraph with a subheading “Success Story: [Business Name]” describing how Arzani helped a specific client, including before/after metrics (like increased sale price or reduced time to sell). End it with that client’s testimonial quote. This can be in the social proof section or in a sidebar. It serves readers who like narrative proof, adding depth beyond one-line quotes.
Third-Party Endorsements: Sometimes, having an industry expert or influencer endorsement can be social proof. E.g., if a known small business consultant or a well-known platform (like a quote from a CEO of a related company or a professor) says something positive about Arzani or its approach (“AI valuations are the future of small business sales” – Dr. So-and-so, Business School). If Arzani has any advisory board or notable backers, mention of that can instill trust (e.g., “Backed by alumni of [prestigious incubator]”). This might be beyond scope, but worth noting as a tactic.
Placement Timing: Make sure by the time a user is considering the CTA, they have encountered some social proof. We wouldn’t want the CTA to appear before any trust has been built. In our layout, hero (CTA) is first, but that’s common – and we ameliorate it by possibly including a micro-proof near it and by quickly following with reasons and proof. As they scroll, they hit social proof mid-way, which should seal trust. And then at the bottom CTA we can remind them of trust (like “Start your free valuation – join others who succeeded”).
Don’t Oversell – Authentic Tone: The credibility elements should feel like testimonials, not advertisements. E.g., use natural language that real customers would use, even if it’s not super polished. A slightly unpolished genuine quote can be more credible than a perfectly phrased one that reads like ad copy. Also, if including any star ratings or such, ensure they match actual reviews somewhere (or state “internal survey” or whatever the source is). Modern audiences are savvy and skeptical; anything that looks too good (all 5-star glowing with zero detail) might ironically reduce trust. Balance praise with realism (for instance, a testimonial might mention they were initially skeptical or had a challenge, which they overcame using Arzani – that actually feels real and thus more persuasive).
Security and Privacy Promises: Since part of credibility is also the safety of using the service, reiterate privacy promises where relevant (we do in FAQ and near CTA). Also, ensure the page uses HTTPS (an SSL certificate) – a “Not secure” browser warning would kill trust immediately. This is basic but worth stating: the landing page must be on a secure URL, especially since users will input data.
By skillfully deploying these social proof and credibility elements, we alleviate the fear of “Is this legit? Will this work for me? Have others had success?” Those are the subconscious questions in a visitor’s mind. After seeing the proof, the hope is the visitor thinks, “Others did it and got great results, the company seems trustworthy and competent – I won’t be the guinea pig. Let’s try this.” That confidence is what tips them into clicking the CTA and becoming a lead.
Conversion-Focused Form Design
Since the primary CTA leads to a form submission (to get a free valuation, likely the user needs to provide some information), the design of that form is crucial for conversion. A poorly designed form can cause drop-offs even after a user clicks “Get My Free Valuation.” Below are best practices to ensure the form is user-friendly and optimized to get that lead info:
Keep the Form Short and Simple: Only ask for the information that is absolutely necessary to start the valuation proces​
cxl.com
】. For a free valuation, that might initially be just a couple of fields: e.g., Business Name, Your Name, Email, Phone (optional). Potentially, you might ask for one key business metric to tailor the valuation (like annual revenue or industry) – but consider if you can avoid that in this first step. Remember, each additional form field can reduce conversion rates (more friction​

】. As Peep Laja notes, a form with 1-3 fields is ideal for lead gen if you can manage i​
cxl.com
】. Perhaps Arzani can generate a basic valuation range with minimal info and then follow up for more details. The initial form should lower the barrier: name and contact might suffice to “lock in” their interest. You can always gather more data later via a follow-up email or call (once the lead is captured).
Multi-Step Form (if needed): If you do need more info for a meaningful valuation (for example, industry, years in business, revenue, profit, etc.), consider a multi-step form rather than one long form. Multi-step forms often convert higher because they don’t overwhelm the user at once. The first step could be just contact info (easy stuff) – once they submit that, step 2 asks business specifics. Many users who complete step 1 will continue (commitment consistency). Also, use a progress indicator (“Step 1 of 2”, “Next: Business Details”) to let them know it’s short. For instance, Step 1: Name & Email; Step 2: 3-4 business questions (perhaps in a conversational tone like “What’s your industry? (dropdown), Approximate annual revenue? (range selection)”). Each step should be on its own screen on mobile to avoid a super long scrolling form.
Inline Form in Hero vs Separate Page: We could place the first part of the form right in the hero section (like an email capture field and button). This can increase conversions for folks ready to get started immediately. For example, a single-field “Enter your email to get started” with the CTA. However, an argument could be made to not show the form until they click the CTA (to not intimidate those who need persuasion first). This is something to test. One approach is: have the CTA button in hero open a lightbox form or scroll to a form section labeled “Get Your Free Valuation.” This way, those who click are showing intent and then see the form. Alternatively, an embedded mini-form (name, email, submit) in the hero can capture quick wins. If doing that, ensure the form is very short (just one or two fields), and you can collect the rest later. For example, “Get my free valuation” in hero could actually be an email field + button. Pressing it either submits and then shows step 2 or at least captures email so if they abandon later, you still got a lead to follow up with.
Form Field Design: Design fields with clear labels. Place labels above the field or inside as placeholders but if using placeholders, ensure that upon focus out the typed text is clearly visible and the user doesn’t forget what the field was. Many modern forms use floating labels (the text moves above as a mini-label when you start typing). That can be nice for saving space and clarity. Use helpful defaults where possible (e.g., a dropdown for industry pre-filled with “Select industry”). Mark optional fields clearly if any (and consider making most fields optional except maybe contact info, to reduce friction – you can follow up to get missing data).
Error Handling and Validation: Implement real-time validation to catch errors before submission. For instance, if the email format is wrong, show a small red hint “Please enter a valid email” as they move off the field. When they hit submit, if something’s missing, highlight the field in red and give a helpful message. Make sure the error messages are in plain language (e.g., “Please fill in your business name” rather than a generic “Field required”). This prevents frustration. Also, ensure that if the user does encounter an error, the form doesn’t wipe all their inputs – nothing is more annoying than filling details, getting an error, and losing everything typed. Always preserve what they entered so they can just correct one field.
Privacy Reassurance: Right below the form or submit button, include a note about privacy. For instance, “💡 Your valuation is confidential. We won’t share your data with anyone.” or “We respect your privacy and will only use your info to provide your valuation.” This is especially important in B2B because owners are protective of their business info. A reassurance can increase their willingness to submit the form. Also provide a link to the privacy policy (could be a small text link “Privacy Policy”) – but have it open in a modal or new tab so they don’t completely navigate awa​

】.
Call-to-Action on Submit Button: The submit button on the form should continue the same phrasing: e.g., “Get My Free Valuation” (if it’s the final step) or “Next: See My Valuation” if multi-step. If multi-step, the final step’s button could say “Get My Valuation Report” to indicate this click finishes the process. Make the button full-width on mobile for easy tapping. Also, consider using a contrasting color consistent with earlier CTA buttons.
Loading/Success Feedback: After clicking submit, provide immediate feedback. For example, change the button to a loading spinner or “Submitting…” state so the user knows it’s processing. Then show a thank-you or confirmation message. Possibly, the landing page could then either:
Display a confirmation text in place of the form (e.g., “Thank you! Your valuation is being prepared. We’ll reach out to you at [email].” and perhaps what to expect next).
Or redirect to a dedicated thank-you page with next steps (which could be an opportunity to upsell or provide more info).
The key is to finalize the conversion loop with a positive reinforcement. Even something like “Success! Check your email for your valuation report within X hours” if it’s not instant, or “Success! Our team will contact you within one business day to personally review your valuation.” Setting the expectation manages the relationship going forward.
Minimize Friction and Cognitive Load: Use smart defaults if available. For instance, if the valuation is presumably for UK businesses only (Arzani is UK-based), maybe default country = UK so they don’t have to fill that. If there’s a phone field, pre-format or auto-detect country code. If industry field, provide a dropdown or auto-suggest so they don’t have to type from scratch. Each little convenience helps. Also, avoid asking for information that might be sensitive right off the bat. For example, owners might hesitate to provide detailed financials to an unknown platform through a form. It might be better to get basic contact info and then have an analyst follow up for financial details, or at least reassure them that any detailed info will be handled securely (with NDA if needed). Our form should feel easy and safe to fill.
Accessible Forms: Ensure form fields have proper labels for screen readers. Also, the form should be navigable by keyboard (for accessibility and for power users who prefer keyboard). This also means the focus outline should be visible when tabbing through fields (don’t remove outline in CSS without providing an alternative). While many of Arzani’s users will be sighted and using mouse/touch, catering to all users is part of good practice and sometimes legally required (accessibility).
Mobile Form Considerations: On mobile, when the on-screen keyboard pops up, it can occlude half the screen. Make sure the form is designed such that when you focus a field on mobile, it scrolls into view above the keyboard (so the user isn’t typing blindly). Also keep fields minimal to reduce typing. Possibly integrate device capabilities – e.g., allow voice dictation (that’s more on the user’s side with their keyboard). For phone number, the numeric keypad makes entry easier.
Use of Captcha/Spam Prevention: If the form is publicly accessible, consider how to avoid spam bot submissions (which can pollute leads). A simple Google reCAPTCHA v3 (invisible) can be used, or at least a honeypot field (an invisible field that humans won’t fill but bots might, to filter them). However, don’t use a clunky CAPTCHA that the user has to solve (like image selection) unless spam becomes a problem – those can hurt conversion significantly due to annoyance. Aim for behind-the-scenes solutions.
Form Placement on Landing Page: If we implement as a two-step (CTA then form), the landing page itself might not show the full form until CTA is clicked. If the form is part of the page content (like a separate section or the hero), ensure it’s visually appealing. Often, a form can be placed inside a bordered box or with a slight background shade to stand out. For example, a light grey panel with the form fields, making it clear it’s an input area. Use concise instructional text if needed above the form: e.g., “Get started with your free valuation – just fill out the details below:” This can set context. We had that in the final CTA section plan (essentially repeating invitation to fill the form).
Offer Help on the Form: Sometimes putting a small help link like “Need help? Contact us.” near the form can catch people who might be stuck or have last-minute doubts. This could open a chat or bring them to a contact page. Alternatively, if Arzani has live chat, a chat widget can pop up especially on the form page saying “Have questions? Chat with us while you fill this out.” That can rescue conversions that might otherwise abandon. If doing this, ensure the chat widget doesn’t cover the form fields (place it bottom corner out of the way).
By focusing on form UX in these ways, we ensure that once a user decides to convert, nothing in the form stops them. The mantra is “Don’t make me think” – the form should be intuitive. Many landing page efforts fail not because the user isn’t convinced, but because the final conversion step (the form) is tedious or confusing. We will avoid that trap, keeping the form as a smooth final leg of the journey.
A/B Testing Recommendations
After implementing the landing page with all these best practices, continuous improvement comes from A/B testing (split testing). The idea is to empirically find what actually boosts conversions by testing one variant against another with real traffic. Here’s a plan for A/B testing Arzani’s landing page and what elements to focus on:
Prioritize High-Impact Elements: Not all parts of the page are equal in influence. Based on experience and research, the elements to test first (in order) are:
Headline and Hero Copy: The headline is often a make-or-break element. Test different versions of the headline. For example, Version A (current): “Designed for UK Small Businesses to Buy, Sell, and Scale” vs. Version B: “Sell Your Business 37% Faster with AI-Powered Valuations.” The latter is more specific and benefit-oriented. Or test a pain-focused headline vs. a solution-focused one. You can also test the subheadline or tweak the value proposition phrasing. Keep one version more straightforward, another maybe with a different angle (but still clear). See which yields higher conversion (form submissions). If one clearly outperforms, adopt that style going forward.
CTA Text/Design: We could test “Get My Free Valuation” vs “Get Your Free Valuation” vs “Get Started – Free Valuation”. It’s a minor copy difference, but sometimes one phrasing clicks better with user​
unbounce.com
】. Also, test CTA design aspects like color: e.g., an orange button vs a blue button (ensuring both are high contrast on page). Run that test and see which color draws more clicks. Another test: having the form directly in the hero vs. a button that opens the form. The metric would be overall conversions (completed forms). If embedding the form yields more completed forms (some studies have shown it can), we’d switch to that approach.
Page Length and Depth of Info: Test a long-form page (including all sections as we’ve planned) vs a shorter page that maybe cuts out some content (for instance, remove the detailed feature section and condense benefits, or remove some FAQs). Some audiences respond better to a concise page that gets right to the point, especially if they came from a trusted referral. Others need all the detail and persuasion. You won’t know for sure until you test. Create a shorter variant that still has the essentials: hero, short pain/solution, one testimonial, CTA. If the short version converts nearly as well or better, that’s insight (maybe users don’t need all the detail). If the long version wins, it means those extra sections are providing needed assurance.
Social Proof Emphasis: Test different social proof approaches. For example, Version A: testimonials (as in our page), vs Version B: a more stats/number-driven approach (like a big banner “1,000+ businesses trust Arzani” plus logos, and maybe fewer testimonials). See which resonates more. Alternatively, test presence or absence of a particular testimonial that might be very strong – does adding a specific high-profile testimonial increase conversion?
Imagery: Test the hero image or visual. Version A could have, say, an illustration of people shaking hands on a business deal; Version B might have a screenshot of the Arzani platform/interface. Or A: friendly human image, B: more techy abstract image. This can tell you what kind of visual your audience responds to (emotional human connection vs seeing the product). Keep everything else same while testing image. Similarly, test adding a short explainer video in the hero vs. just static image – sometimes videos increase engagement, other times they distract or slow load. If Arzani can produce a 1-minute intro video, that could be an interesting test (monitor both conversion and engagement metrics).
Form Variations: If using multi-step form, test single-step vs multi-step (does breaking it actually improve completion?). Or test fewer fields vs a version with one extra required field to gauge impact on lead quality vs quantity. For example, test requiring phone number vs making it optional. If requiring phone drops conversion significantly, you might decide to keep it optional or off. If it doesn’t hurt much, requiring it might give you more qualified leads ready for sales follow-up. Always weigh lead quality too – a slightly lower conversion rate might be acceptable if the leads are much more qualified. You can measure quality by looking at how many leads turn into actual sales or serious conversations.
Personalization/Segmentation: If feasible, test separate landing pages for sellers vs buyers vs acquirers. For example, run an ad campaign for “sell your business” that goes to a variant page tailored entirely to sellers (headline: “Sell Your Business…”, content focused on selling), versus the generic combined page. Compare conversion rates between targeted vs generic. If the targeted performs better, it may be worth maintaining multiple versions for different audiences. Tools exist to dynamically swap content based on ad parameters (e.g., using Unbounce’s Dynamic Text Replacement or custom scripts) – you could personalize the headline to say “Sell Your [Industry] Business” if the ad passed an industry parameter, etc. Those advanced tests can significantly boost relevance when done right.
Test One Major Change at a Time: To attribute results, run tests where the two versions differ in one significant aspect. Don’t create completely two different pages with dozens of changes – you won’t know which element caused the difference. For instance, test headline alone (keeping rest same). Then test CTA color separately, etc. An exception is you can test two entirely different design concepts (multivariate), but that’s usually later after testing key pieces. Early on, isolate variables for clarity.
Measure the Right Metrics: The primary metric is conversion rate (form submissions as a percentage of unique visitors). Secondary metrics could be click-through rate on the CTA (for parts of funnel), but ultimately a submitted lead is what matters. If using multi-step, measure how many start vs finish to see if drop-off is at a certain question. Use analytics (like Google Analytics or built-in landing page analytics) to track scroll depth and time on page too: if users aren’t scrolling far, maybe your content arrangement needs adjusting (like important info higher). A/B testing tools (Google Optimize, Optimizely, VWO, etc.) can handle the random traffic split and statistical significance calculation.
Statistical Significance & Traffic: Ensure you run the test long enough to get a significant sample. In B2B, traffic might be lower volume, so be patient. For example, if your baseline conversion is 10% and you want to detect a lift to 12%, you might need a few hundred visitors per variant to be sure. Many A/B testing calculators are available to estimate needed sample. Run tests for at least 1-2 full business cycles (like over different days of week) to account for variability. Don’t stop a test early just because one variant seems ahead – early fluctuations can even out. Aim for 95% confidence level before declaring a winner.
Qualitative Feedback During Testing: Alongside quantitative tests, gather qualitative data. Use a tool for user session recordings or heatmaps (like Hotjar or Crazy Egg) to see where people click or where they may get stuck. Consider a small exit survey: “What stopped you from getting a valuation today?” – this can reveal if a certain objection wasn’t addressed or if the form was too long, etc. This qualitative insight can generate new test ideas. For instance, if many say “I’m just browsing, not ready to sell now,” maybe test adding content that says “Even if you’re not ready to sell yet, a valuation can help you plan” to see if that improves conversions of early-stage visitors.
Test Continuous, but One at a Time: You can have a testing roadmap: first headline, then CTA, then length, etc. Each test can build on the last. When you find a winner, adopt it and then test the next thing on that new version. Over time, you’ll zero in on the most effective combination. Just be careful to reset or account for any seasonality or campaign changes when comparing results. It’s an iterative optimization process.
Don’t Forget to Test Content Tone: We assume professional tone is best (and likely it is for this context). But it could be interesting down the line to test a slightly more conversational or bold tone in copy. Perhaps test a version of the headline that’s more provocative (e.g., “Your Business Is Worth More Than You Think. Find Out How Much – Free.”) versus the baseline. Or test adding humor vs staying formal. These are finer points, but sometimes a touch of personality can differentiate in a sea of bland B2B pages. However, always ensure clarity is not compromised for cleverness unless you have strong reason to believe the clever message resonates bette​

】. Those kinds of tests make sense once the basics (clarity, structure) are nailed.
Segment Testing: Look at whether different segments behave differently. For example, maybe mobile users convert less – you might A/B test something specifically for mobile (like sticky CTA vs none). Or perhaps traffic from Google Ads vs organic search responds differently – you might run separate experiments for those segments (with tools that allow targeting by referrer or UTM parameters). This way you optimize for each key segment of traffic.
Document and Learn: Keep a record of tests run, results, and insights. Over time you’ll build a knowledge base of what messaging works for Arzani’s audience. For example, you might discover “Pain-focused headlines consistently beat benefit-focused ones for our audience” or “Including industry-specific details improves conversion for niche campaigns.” These learnings inform not just the landing page, but broader marketing strategy and even product messaging.
In essence, treat the landing page as a living project. Launch with best practices (like the ones we’ve compiled) but verify them in the field. CRO (Conversion Rate Optimization) is about empirical improvement. Given Rightbiz is a competitor, presumably Arzani might test elements to outperform whatever Rightbiz is doing. For instance, if Rightbiz’s page has one approach to social proof, Arzani can test an alternative approach to see if it resonates more. Over time, Arzani’s landing page will become finely tuned to its audience, giving it a competitive edge.
Landing Page Wireframe Template with Annotated Sections
To visualize all these recommendations, below is a wireframe-style layout of the landing page with key sections labeled. This serves as a template structure that Arzani can follow when designing the page: 

】 Annotated wireframe of a landing page structure, showing the hero with headline/CTA (Hero), testimonial quotes (Testimonials), feature descriptions with images (Feature), a row of social proof logos (Social Proof Logos), and a final heading with call-to-action at the bottom (Call To Action Bottom​

】. As illustrated in the wireframe above, the landing page is organized into distinct sections:
Hero Section (Top): Highlighted in the wireframe as “Hero”, this area contains the main headline, subheadline, and a prominent CTA button (or form). It occupies the top banner of the page (often with a background color or image). This is where the unique value proposition and primary action are immediately visible.
Testimonials (Social Proof) Section: Immediately following the hero, the wireframe shows a section for Testimonials – typically with short quotes and attributions (e.g., “—Kenny, —Brad” in the image). In practice, this could be one or two powerful testimonials to build trust earl​

】. We might integrate one testimonial here or a rating badge as discussed, while saving a fuller set of testimonials for later. (The wireframe example places testimonials quite high, which is an option we could emulate to front-load trust.)
Feature/Benefits Sections: The wireframe labels “Feature 1” blocks in a vertical sequence, each with text and an image placeholder. This corresponds to our Solution/Benefits and Feature sections. In implementation, each “Feature 1” box could represent one major benefit or feature – e.g., AI Valuation, Market Insights, etc., with a small image or icon to the right (as shown) and descriptive text to the left. The template shows two feature blocks; we could have more or fewer depending on content (we planned around 3-5). These blocks use headings (Feature titles) and supporting text. They are visually separated (perhaps alternating background shades or just spacing) to avoid confusion. The wireframe’s use of repeated “Feature 1” sections indicates a modular approach: you can add as many feature sections as needed in a stack, each explaining one key value poin​

Social Proof Logos Row: Toward the bottom of the wireframe, there is a row with icons labeled under “Social Proof Heading” – these represent Social Proof Logos (e.g., client logos, partner logos, or award icons). The template suggests placing a collection of trust symbols in a band across the pag​

】. In our design, this could be a strip saying “Trusted by:” followed by logos of companies or media. It’s positioned above the final CTA in the wireframe, which is a logical spot after giving details and before asking for action one more time. We might title it something like “Trusted by businesses across the UK” as a heading above the logos.
Final Call-To-Action Section: At the very bottom, the wireframe shows “Heading for Call To Action Bottom” and the CTA buttons (even mobile store badges in the example, which might not apply to us). For Arzani, this final section contains a concise closing statement and the Final CTA button/form. It echoes the hero in theme but is more of a last prompt. In the template, it’s clearly delineated, often with a different background or a bold design to stand out. This is where our “Ready to get started?” text and the big “Get My Free Valuation” button will go, as described. The wireframe indicates this section should be visually distinct (for example, a colored background banner) to catch the ey​

】.
Footer (if any): The wireframe shows a basic footer with site links/newsletter in grey at the bottom. For our landing page, we’d keep the footer minimal – perhaps just the company name and privacy/terms links. The exact content isn’t crucial, but it should not distract or lead the user away. It can be very small. In many dedicated landing pages, the footer is omitted or just a tiny line of text to maximize focus.
Using the Template: The above wireframe provides a blueprint. Arzani’s team can use it as a starting point in a wireframing tool or design software, plugging in the actual copy and images we’ve discussed. Each red label in the image corresponds to sections we’ve broken down:
“Hero” = Hero Section with main pitch and CTA.
“Testimonials” = Social proof (initial testimonial or rating highlight).
“Feature” (repeated) = Key Benefits/Features sections.
“Social Proof Logos” = Additional credibility indicators (logos/awards).
“Call To Action Bottom” = Final CTA.
By following this structure, you ensure logical flow (awareness -> interest -> desire -> action) and cover all critical elements of a high-converting pag​

】. The annotations help remind what content goes where, and the order is very much aligned with our content plan and copywriting frameworks:
Hero with UVP & CTA (grabs attention, provides a promise).
(Optional early testimonial) to build quick interest/trust.
Problem & Solution (Features/Benefits) in a scroll-friendly format (maintains interest, builds desire with specifics).
Robust Social Proof section (testimonials, logos) reinforcing credibility (fuels desire, reduces anxiety).
Objection Handling (FAQ) – not explicitly shown in the wireframe, but this could be inserted perhaps between features and the final CTA, or as part of the bottom section. We can integrate FAQs as an expandable area perhaps just above the final CTA banner.
Final CTA (push to action).
It’s worth noting that the wireframe we used had a navigation bar in the very top (“Site Name | Category links | Cart”). For our purposes, we would remove those navigation links as discussed (to avoid distraction​

】. So, in implementing, exclude the category menu – just keep maybe the logo on top for branding, or a simple header. The template emphasizes simplicity and focus. It’s not cluttered: each section has one main purpose. This is exactly what we want – each block we designed (hero, proof, features, etc.) is fulfilling a role in persuading the visitor. Using this wireframe, Arzani’s designers can create a high-fidelity design, replacing placeholders with real content:
Swap “Landing Page Hero Heading” with our actual compelling headline.
Replace lorem ipsum in features with our benefit statements.
Put real testimonial text in place of those dummy quotes.
Insert Arzani’s or clients’ logos in that social proof row.
Put the actual CTA button labeled properly.
Because the wireframe is already annotated with section labels, it doubles as a checklist to ensure no key section is omitted during design. It can also be shared with stakeholders to communicate the page layout before moving to visual design. In conclusion, this annotated wireframe aligns with the best practices we’ve outlined and provides a visual guide to building Arzani’s landing page. By following it, Arzani can implement the page systematically: section by section, focusing on conversion-centered design (clear value prop, one action, trust elements, no extraneous links​
