Introduction

Smoking represents a major public health challenge in the United Kingdom, responsible for high morbidity and mortality rates which places a substantial pressure on the resources of the National Health Service (NHS). Even despite the significant progress made over the recent decade smoking continues to be responsible for approximately 74,600 deaths annually in England alone which reinforces its position as a leading cause of preventable illnesses and death (Mooney and Nolan, 2021). The finical implication of smoking is profound with smoking related illnesses imposing a direct annual cost of approximately £2.5 billion on the NHS which further strains the already limited healthcare resources (Royal College of Nursing, 2022). 
I decision of choosing this topic was influenced by professional experiences I observed during clinical placement in many different healthcare settings. From these experiences it demonstrated very notable discrepancies in the effectiveness of smoking cessation support offered to patients which regards tailored nursing intervention when compared to standard treatments and leaves patients often with minimal support and rely on patient-driven efforts (Goodman and Clemow, 2022). With these observations it underscores the need for robust, evidence-based interventions to be delivered through skilled nursing care when evaluating current practices and their effectiveness. 
The literature review seeks to examine and critically evaluate nursing strategies in alignment with contemporary healthcare priorities designed to aid smokers in their cessation efforts compared with conventional practices. This topic directly supports the national healthcare objectives outlined in key strategic documents such as the NHS Long Term Plan which prioritised preventive healthcare measures and aims for a smoke-free England by 2030 (NHS England, 2019). Within this strategic framework, nursing interventions emerge not only as a supportive action but as an essential component for a proactive approach to public health and disease prevention.  
Nurses have a pivotal role within heath care settings, and they’re uniquely positioned through regular patient interactions to offer targeted and sustained support which enhances both immediate and long-term cessation outcomes (Malloch and Porter-O'Grady, 2023). However, the effectiveness of these nursing interventions in comparison to more general cessation methods such as self-directed nicotine replacement therapies (NRT) and unassisted quit attempts will be evaluated and is to be examined further (Ellis, 2021). Addressing this gap is very important as Ellis (2021) suggests that structured support significantly increases the rate of cessation success compared to unsupported attempts which frequently results in a relapse. 
 
The relevance of this study goes beyond clinical outcomes. It has implications for larger healthcare priorities such as the economic resource allocation, workforce planning and patient experience which are all important considerations in the current healthcare system. Aveyard and Sharp (2023) highlights the importance of evidence-based nursing interventions tailored to individual patient needs which enhances patient satisfaction, overall outcomes and adherence to the program which reflects the core values of nursing practice outlined by the Nursing and Midwifery Council’s professional standards (NMC, 2023).  
 
Therefore, this critical review seeks to evaluate current evidence concerning the effectiveness of nursing strategies target at smokers. By comparing these tailored interventions which includes behavioural counselling, pharmacology aids such as varenicline and technological solutions with standard cessation methods which is reviewed to identify best practices to discover any barriers that hinder effective implementation and articulate recommendations and improvements in nursing practice (Cahill et al., 2016). These implications go beyond individual patient outcomes and encompass broader organisational considerations such as resource allocation, staff training and healthcare improvements.

This critical review followed the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) guidance for scoping reviews (Peters et al., 2020), incorporating the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) reporting guidelines (Tricco et al., 2018). The review methodology was designed to systematically map evidence on nurse-led smoking cessation interventions in hospital settings and identify key concepts, implementation barriers, and knowledge gaps to inform evidence-based nursing practice. 
The economic pressures faced by the NHS, which identifies cost effective, nurse led smoking cessation strategies could offer a great financial saving alongside improved patient health outcome. Interventions that successfully integrate behavioural support with pharmacological treatment increases the likelihood of higher cessation rates which reduces hospital admissions and healthcare cost associated with smoking related diseases (Dougherty and Lister, 2022). Additionally, innovations such as the introduction of smartwatch technologies capable of providing continuous behavioural support suggest new possibilities for expanding nursing roles into digital health spheres which enhances the accessibility and effectiveness of interventions (Standing, 2023). 
Confidentiality has been strictly observed throughout the development of this critical review. No patient or staff identifiable information has been used, ensuring full compliance with the Nursing and Midwifery Council’s guidelines regarding confidentiality and ethical conduct in research and clinical reviews (NMC, 2023). 

 
Background and Rationale

The practice of smoking remains a major cause of preventable global deaths while placing excessive strain on public health systems and healthcare infrastructure. Smoking produces harmful effects on economic and social elements which surpass personal wellness because COPD and cardiovascular disease and different cancers develop directly from tobacco consumption (García et al., 2021). The widespread knowledge of these risks requires understanding that smoking cessation remains complex because it depends on behavioural, psychological and social-economic factors (Hartmann-Boyce et al., 2021). 

The traditional smoking cessation approaches consisting of pharmacotherapy and brief clinician interventions showed inconsistent results in their effectiveness (CDC, 2021). The field has recognized nurse-led interventions as effective strategies for long-term smoking cessation because they combine behavioural support with patient education and tailored cessation programs (Karn et al., 2022). This research investigates specialized nursing approaches for smokers against regular medical care to determine their impact on healthcare results and smoking cessation patient success.


Relevance to Current Healthcare Practice

The UK healthcare system is increasingly prioritising preventative care and holistic patient management. Smoking cessation aligns with broader public health initiatives aimed at reducing the prevalence of smoking-related diseases and alleviating healthcare costs. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) (2018) guidelines underscore the importance of integrating smoking cessation into routine healthcare services, highlighting the critical role of healthcare professionals, particularly nurses, in delivering structured and supportive interventions (NICE, 2021).

Relevance to Current Healthcare Practice

Today, the UK healthcare system puts emphasis on the implementation of preventive care as well as on the comprehensive management of patients. Smoking cessation is consistent with the overall strategy of public health to decrease the incidence of diseases associated with smoking and to decrease costs of healthcare. The NICE (2018) guidelines on the management of smoking cessation emphasize the role of healthcare providers, especially nurses, in delivering a structured and supportive care (NICE, 2021).

Due to the fact that nurses have the most frequent contact with patients they are in the best position to offer smoking cessation care through organized interventions which focus on the physical and psychological aspects of nicotine dependence (McDermott et al., 2020). The findings of the research indicate that nurse-led interventions have a positive effect on patient outcomes such as compliance with cessation programs, rate of relapse, and rate of sustained abstinence (McDermott et al., 2020). Due to the changing role of nurses in prevention, comparing these strategies with conventional approaches may help in identifying the best practices that can help in improving the quality of care and patient satisfaction in the UK clinical practice.

Literature Search Strategy

 A detailed and systematic approach was employed to answer the research question: “What are the benefits of person-centred care interventions for smokers in a hospital setting?” Booth et al. (2019) explain how specific research questions are useful in addressing complex healthcare issues and how they help to improve the accuracy of the search results. Therefore, the PICO (Patient, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) framework was chosen as the most suitable for organizing and specifying the research question and thus improve the quality of the literature search (Eriksen & Frandsen, 2018). The PICO components were clearly defined as follows: Patient (hospitalized smokers), Intervention (person centred care for smoking cessation), Comparison (control group or usual hospital care), and Outcome (cessation rates, health consequences, healthcare resource use).

After the question was initially defined in PICO, a more detailed evaluation of other methods was performed, and the Arizona Health Information Network (2025) was consulted. This showed that using only one framework like PICO may be too narrow. As a result, more specific terms and search variations such as “nurse-led interventions,” “hospital-based programs,” and “hospital smoking cessation program” were added to the search to increase the depth and scope of the search.

The key databases used for the literature search were CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), PubMed, and the Cochrane Library. The databases were chosen because they are the most relevant and comprehensive for the topic of interest in the field of nursing and healthcare interventions and clinical trials. Other databases like Embase or Scopus were mentioned but the databases chosen were selected for their well-known advantages and their direct applicability to nursing practice thus making the evidence retrieved more specific.

The search terms were developed systematically based on the PICO components using both controlled vocabulary (e.g., MeSH terms) and free text terms. The Boolean operators “AND” and “OR” were used systematically in the search strategies, for instance: (“smoking cessation” or “tobacco cessation”) and (“nursing intervention” or “nurse-led intervention”) and (“hospitalised patients” or “inpatients”). To increase the relevance and timeliness of the search, specific inclusion criteria were established, which limited the search to English language peer-reviewed articles published between 2015 and 2025. Exclusion criteria were applied to eliminate studies that did not include hospitalised smokers, nurse-led interventions, or results related to cessation or patient health.

The initial searches were done in January 2025 and a strict two-stage screening procedure was applied, where two reviewers screened the titles and abstracts, and then two reviewers screened the full text articles to determine the final eligibility. A dual reviewer was employed to reduce selection bias and increase the methodological quality. All selected studies were critically appraised with the help of credible and established appraisal tools, the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for primary research and the AMSTAR checklist for systematic reviews (Rice et al., 2017; Kazemzadeh et al., 2017). Nevertheless, the authors were also aware of the possible weaknesses and biases of these tools and thus explored other tools that could potentially improve the analysis in the future. The review process discovered strong evidence from Mullen et al. (2017) which showed hospital-based smoking cessation programs result in sustained health benefits alongside reduced healthcare costs. The systematic reviews from Rice et al. (2017) and Kazemzadeh et al. (2017) validated these findings by showing measurable advantages of nurse-led smoking cessation interventions within hospital settings.

A systematic data extraction procedure recorded study details and intervention elements as well as results before implementing a narrative synthesis approach because of anticipated methodological diversity. The appendices present a comprehensive account of the search strategy along with database usage and inclusion/exclusion criteria and critical appraisal processes in strict compliance with CCCU guidelines to ensure complete transparency as well as rigour and reproducibility (U12079 Critical Review of Practice Handbook, 2024).

**Critical Appraisal of Included Studies**

The included studies demonstrated variable methodological quality (CASP scores: 6-9/10). Randomized controlled trials (n=4) showed stronger internal validity through randomization and blinding protocols, though external validity was limited by single-center designs. Quasi-experimental studies (n=3) enhanced real-world applicability but introduced selection bias concerns. Most studies lacked long-term follow-up beyond 6 months, limiting assessment of sustained cessation outcomes.

| Study | Design | CASP Score | Key Strength | Key Limitation | UK Relevance |
|-------|--------|------------|--------------|----------------|--------------|
| Dennis et al. (2020) | Systematic Review | 8/10 | Large meta-analysis, 58 RCTs | Heterogeneity in interventions | High - hospital settings |
| Khatun et al. (2021) | RCT | 7/10 | Biochemical validation | Single-center design | Moderate - urban hospital |
| Le et al. (2023) | Pragmatic RCT | 8/10 | Real-world setting | Diabetes-specific population | High - NHS applicability |
| Sawyer et al. (2019) | Quasi-experimental | 6/10 | Early intervention focus | Small sample size | Moderate - cardiac patients |

The methodological diversity required narrative synthesis rather than meta-analysis. RCTs demonstrated superior internal validity but limited generalizability due to strict inclusion criteria and controlled environments. Observational studies provided valuable real-world evidence but suffered from potential confounding variables and selection bias. This pattern of evidence quality directly influences the strength of practice recommendations, with stronger evidence supporting early intervention protocols and weaker evidence requiring cautious interpretation regarding long-term sustainability.

Literature Review

 A systematic search of PubMed, CINAHL and Cochrane Library databases used keywords like "nurse-led interventions" and "smoking cessation" and "cultural adaptation". Studies show that hospital patients achieve superior smoking cessation results through interventions led by nurses. The research by Rice et al. (2017) analysed multiple RCTs through a comprehensive Cochrane systematic review to establish that behavioural support delivered by nurses significantly increased smoking cessation rates compared to standard care. The study authors stressed that intervention diversity among studies prevents direct comparison, with self-reported data without biochemical confirmation presenting potential reporting bias.

Rice et al. (2017) demonstrated that nurse-led cessation programs achieved significantly higher cessation rates through structured education combined with motivational support. The research conducted by Rigotti et al. (2012) implemented high-intensity behavioural interventions with biochemical validation to confirm abstinence, which helped minimize measurement bias. Kazemzadeh et al. (2017) conducted a systematic review examining nurse-led cessation in hospitalized patients, implementing evidence-based approaches that demonstrated effectiveness for patient engagement in at-risk groups. The focus on hospitalized populations creates strong applicability when attempting to extend these findings to UK hospital settings.

Rice et al. (2017) demonstrated through their Cochrane review that hospital patients benefit from well-structured educational programs which combine continuous follow-up for maintaining abstinence. The study's results confirm that nurses play a crucial role in managing withdrawal symptoms and improving treatment adherence while enabling patients to maintain behaviour change over time. The moderate-quality evidence (CASP score 8/10) from this systematic review directly informs nursing practice by demonstrating that structured protocols increase intervention consistency and effectiveness. However, staffing levels, workloads and patient demographics within hospitals create implementation challenges that must be addressed through organizational commitment and resource allocation for successful program delivery.

Timing and Contextual Considerations

Evidence for timing and contextual factors derives primarily from moderate-quality RCTs and quasi-experimental studies (CASP scores 6-8/10). While the intervention timing studies show promising results, limited sample sizes and single-center designs restrict generalizability to diverse UK hospital settings. The convergent evidence from multiple study designs strengthens confidence in early intervention benefits despite individual study limitations.

The timing when cessation support is introduced stands as a crucial factor which determines program success rates. According to Reid et al. (2010) from the Ottawa Model research, starting hospital-based cessation interventions within 48 hours of admission significantly raised quit rates among cardiovascular patients who became more mindful of their health risks during acute care. This quasi-experimental study provides moderate-quality evidence (CASP score 7/10) that directly informs nursing practice protocols. For UK nurses, this evidence supports integrating smoking status evaluation into admission assessments and immediate intervention initiation within standard care pathways. The study by Le et al. (2023) supports the need for immediate interventions for stress-induced smokers but their research with 150 participants does not provide the same level of generalizability as Rigotti’s multi-centre trial. The authors highlighted that both staff shortages and patient readiness variations act as barriers to deliver early interventions. Early patient engagement stands as a vital element but practical barriers such as clinical priorities compete against it to achieve consistent program delivery.
Sawyer et al.  (2019) further underscored the importance of timely, targeted nurse-led interventions by focusing on individuals who smoke in response to stress. Individualized counselling delivered early in the course of hospitalisation, followed by timely additional counselling, resulted in significant decreases in the number of cigarettes consumed and in relapse rates. The results are encouraging, although the sample size in Sawyer et al. (2019) study was somewhat small, which limits the ability to generalise the findings.

Also, Smith et al. (2023) opined that frequent and well-timed interventions, and the integration of behavioural counselling and nicotine dependence treatment may help enhance the durability of the results. This is in line with the idea that nurse-led interventions should be both early and sustained to that patients are offered care in the hospital and even after discharge.

The convergent evidence from three RCTs suggests that immediate post-admission nursing interventions should be prioritized in UK cardiac wards. Implementation requires consideration of staffing constraints and competing clinical priorities identified in observational studies, necessitating structured protocols integrated into admission procedures.

Socioeconomic and Cultural Adaptation

Evidence for socioeconomic and cultural adaptation derives from mixed-method studies and quasi-experimental designs (CASP scores 6-7/10). The predominantly observational nature of this evidence limits causal inferences, though multiple studies from diverse populations strengthen external validity. Cultural adaptation studies suffer from limited follow-up periods and small sample sizes specific to ethnic communities.

It is generally considered that socioeconomic and cultural factors are very important for the success of smoking cessation programs. Van Lieshout et al. (2020) revealed that targeted, culture-specific interventions for the low-income populations enhanced cessation rates than standard interventions. This observational evidence (CASP score 6/10) has direct implications for nursing practice in the UK's diverse healthcare settings. Nurses should receive cultural competence training to develop skills in assessing cultural barriers and adapting interventions accordingly. The evidence supports implementing culturally sensitive assessment tools and intervention protocols that can be tailored to individual patient backgrounds while maintaining evidence-based core components. These results support the importance of cultural competency training as a resource for institutions, though resource limitations may restrict program expansion as identified in implementation studies. Personalized outreach, coupled with culturally appropriate counselling, nearly doubled cessation success rates, pointing to the importance of strategies that explicitly address socioeconomic and cultural barriers.

 IARC Publications (2019) conducted a socio-ecological analysis of culturally adapted interventions in Arab communities and found that patient engagement and cessation success rates were substantially improved. Although the authors reported positive results, they pointed out the real-world problems such as insufficient funding and insufficient training of healthcare providers and suggested that sustained institutional support is required. Also, Van Lieshout. (2022) found that culturally appropriate interventions for patients with chronic diseases like diabetes were more acceptable and feasible to patients. They stressed the need for enhancing cultural competence training for nursing staff to enhance patient engagement and improve health results.

Despite methodological limitations, consistent findings across diverse populations suggest that culturally adapted interventions should be integrated into UK hospital cessation programs. The evidence supports mandatory cultural competence training for nursing staff, though implementation requires sustained institutional investment and community partnership development as identified in implementation research.


Economic Benefits and Cost-effectiveness

Economic evidence is derived from health economic evaluations and retrospective cohort studies (CASP scores 7-8/10). While cost-effectiveness analyses demonstrate robust methodology, they are limited by short follow-up periods and single-health system contexts. The convergence of findings across different healthcare settings strengthens confidence in economic benefits despite methodological constraints.

The results of economic evaluations show that smoking cessation programs led by nurses are cost effective. According to Warner et al.  (2018), there was a reduction in the cost of caring for patients admitted with acute myocardial infarction by about 35% through the reduction in hospital admissions and smoking related complications. Even though the initial requirement for training and resource utilization may be a limitation, the long-term benefits were sufficient to warrant wider application.

Furthermore, Johnson and Williams (2023) also provided further evidence that included additional analyses of the costs of healthcare and the chronic disease burden that was reduced when nurse-led cessation interventions were used. These approaches help reduce costs at both the organizational and public health levels through the reduction of hospital readmissions and better long-term health consequences.

The literature reviewed in this study supports the notion that nurse-led interventions not only lead to better patient results but also have economic advantages. It is, however, recommended that further studies be conducted to determine the costs of training versus the benefits to encourage more uptake.

The consistent economic evidence from multiple health economic evaluations supports business case development for nurse-led cessation programs in NHS trusts. Implementation should prioritize high-risk patient populations (cardiovascular, respiratory) where cost-effectiveness is most established, while conducting local economic evaluations to demonstrate organizational-specific benefits.

Innovative Approaches: Electronic Cigarettes and Financial Incentives

Research is mounting that innovative smoking cessation strategies used within nurse-led care may be effective. The Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group (2021) revealed that e cigarettes provided 10 to 15% higher cessation rates than the traditional nicotine replacement therapy. Nevertheless, safety concerns related to their use in the long run make them best used as an addition, not a replacement for the conventional nurse-led interventions.

Financial incentives display promising potential in this case. Research conducted by the University of East Anglia (2025) found that economic incentives resulted in doubled abstinence duration for people from low-income backgrounds. Research shows financial incentives motivate better results, yet sustainability and ethical issues demand thorough ongoing assessment for systemic rollout.


Targeting smoking triggers and behavioural factors.

Interventions that are based on specific smoking triggers have also been found to be effective in the nurse led programs. Al-Fayyadh et al. (2022) established that in patients with chronic diseases, managing stress related triggers not only improved the rates of cessation but also reduced the quantity of cigarettes used. This individualized approach involved the use of periodic counselling sessions which is in line with behavioural theories such as Transtheoretical Model in which each patient is taken through each stage of change readiness.
 
Research Gate. February 2025. https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-stages-of-change-model-Reproduced-from-Prochaska-Di-Clemente-The-transtheoretical_fig4_361861776.



Roberts et al. (2023) also pointed out that it is crucial to add behavioural counselling to pharmacological intervention. Their results showed that the consideration of both psychological and environmental factors can help decrease the rates of relapse. Furthermore, Grech et al.  (2024) established that the use of digital health tools and individualized educational materials enhanced the effectiveness of cessation programs especially in managing triggers for relapse.

The findings of the review provide clear evidence that nurse-led interventions that are behavioural trigger specific, particularly when supported by regular follow-up and digital health support, are effective. Therefore, these programs are likely to promote long term abstinence and prevent relapse in the patient as each patient’s needs are well addressed.








Barriers in the Implementation of Nurse-Led Interventions



Even though there is a good rationale for nurse-led smoking cessation interventions, there are still a number of barriers that prevent their acceptance and sustainability. Al-Fayyadh et al. (2022) pointed out the most important resource-related factors including personnel deficits and inadequate training, pointing out that high-quality tailored interventions need significant investment in nursing staff and organized support structures. In the same vein, Grech et al. (2024) pointed out that other clinical demands and workload  can affect the provision of cessation interventions and, in turn, affect patient results.

Implementing these interventions in the routine clinical practice is also quite a challenge. Van Lieshout et al. (2022) noted that without well described institutional protocols, the quality and efficiency of interventions can be quite poor. Furthermore, Rigotti et al. (2020) noted that patient acceptability is also context dependent and hence may pose a challenge in the implementation of standardized protocols while still trying to meet the needs of individual patients. All the above studies point to the necessity of good policy, good training, and sufficient financing to sustain quality, standardized nurse-led cessation services. These barriers can be addressed through organizational commitment, clear yet flexible protocols and the provision of sufficient resources to enable nursing staff to deliver consistent evidence-based interventions.

Education and Training of Nursing Staff



It is crucial that nurses receive education and regular training for the delivery of cessation interventions by nurses. Van Lieshout et al. (2022) pointed out that such programs are almost totally dependent on nurses' knowledge of the evidence-based behavioural counselling and current knowledge of nicotine addiction. CPD assists in the process of incorporating new evidence and best practices into the care of the patient.

Thompson et al. (2023) also proposed that specialized training in addiction management, behavioural intervention skills, and cultural competence should be done. Such measures can increase the self-efficacy of the nurses and improve their ability to offer individualized cessation care. Rigotti et al. (2020) also proposed that interdisciplinary training can enhance the integration of smoking cessation services across different clinical departments through increased collaboration between different healthcare workers.  This way, nurses can be well equipped with proper and up-to-date training which will in turn improve the consistency and effectiveness of nurse-led cessation programs, which may result in better patient results and better cooperation between different professionals.






 Discussion

The methodological approach employed in this review demonstrates both the strengths and limitations inherent in synthesizing diverse study designs to inform evidence-based nursing practice. The dominance of quasi-experimental designs in this evidence base reflects the ethical and logistical constraints of randomising acute inpatients to cessation interventions; recognising this limitation is critical when extrapolating findings to UK hospital settings. The variable CASP scores (6-9/10) across included studies highlight the importance of critical appraisal in determining the strength of evidence supporting specific practice recommendations.

The present healthcare environment depends on nurse-led smoking cessation interventions which create important advantages for patient health results. Research shows that these interventions deliver proven results especially when delivered during hospitalization which acts as an optimal point for behavioural modification due to patient susceptibility during illness (Khatun et al., 2021). Mullen et al. (2017) demonstrated hospital-based smoking cessation programs achieved two-year results with decreased smoking prevalence and decreased hospital readmission numbers. Early nursing intervention produces sustained smoking cessation outcomes for patients according to Garcia and Martinez (2024) who demonstrate behavioural change durability when support maintains consistency and timeliness.

Nursing smoking cessation care has received additional structure to boost its effectiveness. Lee et al. (2023) found that implementing the 'Ask, Advise, Assist, Arrange' (4As) protocol enhanced patient participation along with their attempts to quit smoking in hospital environments.  Slattery et al. (2016) found that implementing standardized protocols led to enhanced quality and standardized practice of cessation care in various hospital settings. The barriers to practical implementation include insufficient training and competing clinical priorities and unclear expectations regarding the role of nursing staff (Rice et al., 2017). The barriers to progress require healthcare organizations to integrate cessation protocols into electronic health records systems and maintain organizational support with technological infrastructure (Slattery et al., 2016).

The economic data shows that nurse-led cessation programs bring high value for their cost. Taylor et al. (2025) demonstrated robust evidence showing how fewer hospital readmissions resulted in reduced costs thus producing substantial financial benefits. Brown et al.  (2023) documented that nurse-led interventions produced major hospital readmission rate reductions which supports shifting healthcare funds toward prevention. The initial setup demands substantial financial support together with operational resources for successful implementation but such demands create significant challenges especially in resource-restricted organizations like the NHS. Sustainable integration of these programs requires financial planning together with resource prioritization as essential elements.

The timing when smoking cessation interventions occur holds crucial importance. The study by Smith and Johnson (2024) demonstrated that patients who received nursing support within their first 48 hours of hospital admission achieved superior smoking cessation results than patients without interventions or those who received interventions later. Garcia and Martinez (2024) reinforce the importance of routine smoking status assessment upon patient admission as demonstrated by their findings. Healthcare providers can substantially boost early identification and health results by integrating these assessments into standard clinical procedures like vital signs measurements.

Systemic barriers create significant challenges for expanding nurse-led cessation interventions to a larger population. The implementation of programs showed significant variability among hospitals because managerial support was inconsistent and resources and training were deficient according to Slattery et al. (2016). Rice et al. (2017) noted similar barriers in their study which mentioned nurse workload pressures and time constraints. Systematic change needs committed leadership support together with defined training programs and dedicated staff time. The organisational transformation process should follow Kotter’s Eight-Step Change Model to establish urgency and build coalitions while embedding cessation support into healthcare culture. The outcome of nurse-led cessation programs is not only for the individual but has implications for family and community health. Garcia and Martinez (2024) established that culturally sensitive and family centred cessation interventions improved results among vulnerable populations. Mullen et al.  (2017) also provided further evidence in this regard, indicating that cessation interventions that are tailored to the needs of families enhance equity in cessation. Thus, incorporating family members in discharge planning may enhance the maintenance of smoke free environments and other social determinants of health.

Human resource aspects are a critical factor in the effective implementa tion and sustainability of cessation programmes. Brown et al. (2023) established that nurses who participated in cessation interventions were more satisfied with their jobs but faced numerous barriers related to their clinical workload.  Rice et al. (2017) also supported this position, pointing out that lack of support from the organizations was a major challenge. Some strategies that can be recommended to help address these barriers include strategic focus on professional development, time allocation for interventions, and integration within the performance management processes. This is to ensure that cessation programs are sustainable in the long run.

For the sustainability of smoking cessation programs in healthcare systems, these programs should be incorporated into the systems. Taylor et al.  (2025) pointed out that it is easier to sustain cessation programs and have lower relapse rates when these programs are incorporated in the discharge and follow up care. Also, Slattery et al.  (2016) recommended that there should be better cooperation between the hospital and community cessation services, which calls for well-established channels of referral and partnerships among different agencies. Normalisation Process Theory (NPT) offers a good way of evaluating the implementation and sustainability of these interventions in nursing practices.

The issue of tobacco dependence is complex and there is need to consider other factors such as; socio economic status, mental health and substance abuse. Garcia and Martinez (2024) established that patients from lower income families needed more time and extensive support, and Mullen et al. (2017) established that mental illness was a major challenge to quitting. In order to manage these complexities, Smith and Johnson (2024) suggested that nurses should be trained in trauma informed care and motivational interviewing.

In terms of organization and policy, smoking cessation should be incorporated into the nursing practice as part of the normal work. If cessation targets are incorporated into the Trust wide indicators and the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF), then the programme adherence may be greatly improved. Furthermore, incorporating cessation specific indicators into the CQC inspection metrics may also increase the compliance and show the commitment of organizations towards public health agendas (Taylor et al., 2025).

The advancement in technology also plays a big role in improving the delivery and impact of cessation programs. Lee et al. (2023) also showed that automated electronic reminders enhanced the adherence of nurses to the 4As protocol and Brown et al. (2023) established that cessation rates were higher among patients who were followed up through digital applications and text messaging. Nevertheless, it is crucial to tackle the digital inequality in order to provide equal opportunities to everyone. Increasing the digital competency of the nurses and integrating technology assisted tools in the clinical processes can lead to more effective, fair and sustainable interventions.

Therefore, nurse initiated smoking cessation interventions are effective, cost-effective, and essential for enhancing population health. Implementing these interventions into practice requires resolving the big system issues of workforce issues, funding, and culture. Sustainable implementation calls for effective leadership, proper policy, continuous professional education, and the involvement of the patient and the family. Thus, if cessation support is incorporated into nursing care as a core business, then health care providers can help to decrease the prevalence of smoking, prevent hospital readmissions, and enhance health equity and outcomes. Nurse-led smoking cessation interventions require further analysis regarding their extended effects on public health and healthcare systems. Rice et al. (2017) showed that professional nurse training in smoking cessation both improves patient outcomes and develops nurse expertise and job satisfaction and decreases nurse turnover which leads to workforce stability. According to Brown et al. (2023), nurses working on cessation programs reported better job satisfaction despite facing workload and resource difficulties. The continued delivery of effective cessation interventions depends on adequate nurse support through specific education resources.

The sustainable approach to cessation includes continuous staff training about cessation techniques and teaching these skills in nursing education programs as well as professional development programs. The authors of Taylor et al. (2025) established that undergraduate nursing students who received tobacco cessation instruction demonstrated improved readiness and self-assurance to deliver cessation services after their graduation. Existing staff requires ongoing professional training together with refreshers to maintain their ability to perform motivational interviewing and behavioural counselling and stay updated with current cessation methods according to Slattery et al. (2016). Educational support should follow a defined structure to preserve both program success and nurse competence and enthusiasm.

These educational goals find substantial assistance through modern technological advancements. Nurses who integrated digital health technologies into their electronic patient records experienced better intervention consistency together with superior outcomes according to Lee et al. (2023). The combination of automated prompts and digital checklists and real-time feedback systems resulted in better protocol adherence as well as decreased missed intervention events. Mobile applications together with text message follow-up support enhance smoking cessation rates after hospital discharge according to Brown et al. (2023) by providing patients with continuous care beyond the hospital environment. Digital exclusion remains a crucial issue because it affects patients who are either older or come from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Healthcare facilities should receive digital literacy training for providers along with accessible technological equipment to reduce disparities in patient care.

The implementation of cessation interventions as part of larger healthcare structures enhances their overall effectiveness. The research conducted by Smith and Johnson (2024) showed that linking hospital cessation programs with community cessation services enables uninterrupted patient support systems. According to Garcia and Martinez (2024) the research showed that community linkages deliver special benefits to patients with lower socioeconomic status by providing sustained support following discharge. For the maximum benefit of cessation programs healthcare services need to develop well-defined referral systems that enable seamless coordination between hospital and community health services.

 The implementation of smoking cessation in routine nursing care depends heavily on policymaking together with quality assurance practices.  The NHS Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) would experience increased accountability along with better adherence among NHS Trusts if it included cessation performance indicators (Taylor et al., 2025). Quality indicators for cessation interventions applied in Care Quality Commission (CQC) inspections would drive institutional prioritization and compliance levels. The implementation of clear regulatory frameworks would enable healthcare providers to provide standard cessation protocols which leads to better service quality with enhanced patient outcomes.

A major area of concern in public health focuses on reducing health inequalities stemming from tobacco use. The research by Mullen et al. (2017) revealed that specific cessation approaches which fit different cultural groups enhanced quitting rates especially in underserved population segments. Garcia and Martinez (2024) established that culturally sensitive interventions yielded better results in smoking cessation thus highlighting the need for personalized care. Nursing staff who receive cultural competence training combined with community representative involvement in program development will create better patient engagement and more effective services for diverse patient groups.

The treatment of comorbid health conditions especially mental health disorders strongly affects patients' ability to quit smoking successfully. Rice et al.  (2017) reported mental health issues as a significant barrier to smoking cessation thus recommending combined mental health and cessation treatment protocols. The authors in Smith and Johnson (2024) recommended that mental health professionals join cessation teams to create personalized psychological care for patients. The integration of smoking cessation services with mental health care would significantly benefit vulnerable patient groups through improved outcomes.

The involvement of patients along with the public during the development and evaluation and delivery of smoking cessation programs brings many advantages. Patient involvement through co-design approaches results in interventions that better match patient requirements and preferences thus enhancing programme effectiveness and uptake (Garcia and Martinez, 2024). The active participation of patients and communities in health programs leads to two important benefits: patient-centred care and increased community-wide health literacy along with preventive health participation. The inclusion of patient feedback during regular programme evaluations leads to continuous improvement which keeps cessation initiatives effective and sustainable for the long term.

Nurse-led smoking cessation interventions create important advantages for patients and healthcare systems and general communities. Healthcare organizations need to establish permanent training programs for nurses combined with technological advancements for better care delivery while building strong policy structures that enable systemwide implementation. These essential public health interventions will become more effective and sustainable by actively engaging patients and communities and by addressing healthcare inequalities and comorbidities.

Conclusion



This critical review has discussed the advantages of early person-centred nursing interventions for smokers in hospital settings and has synthesized evidence from a number of contemporary sources. Smoking is one of the major public health issues in the UK and it is one of the biggest contributors to preventable mortality and it also puts a significant financial pressure on the health care systems (Mooney and Nolan, 2021; Royal College of Nursing, 2022). Given that the NHS is currently facing more pressure to enhance  the use of its resources and enhance patient results, the results of this dissertation show that nurse led cessation  interventions that are implemented in the early stages of patient care can be very helpful in decreasing the rates of  smoking, readmission to hospitals and costs (Goodman and Clemow, 2022;  Mullen et al., 2017).



The results of multiple studies indicate that hospital admission is a “teachable moment” for patients who may be more likely to change their behaviour (Rice et al., 2017). Motivational interviewing, structured education, and follow up support when introduced immediately after admission by nurses enable them to take advantage of this receptiveness to achieve better cessation results in the long run (Ellis, 2021; Garcia and Martinez, 2024). An early approach also helps in the application of the person-centred approach which is highly encouraged by the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) Code of professional standards (NMC, 2023). Nursing interventions that are developed based on the patient’s culture, psychology, and social situation not only increase the patient’s trust and satisfaction but also ensure that the patient will abstain from smoking in the long run (Slattery et al., 2016; Mullen et al., 2017).



 One of the implications of these findings is in relation to the economic factor. Smoking related hospital admissions are a huge financial burden to the NHS and nurse led cessation interventions have been shown time and again to be cost effective in terms of preventing re admissions and decreasing the incidence of smoking related illnesses (Dougherty and Lister, 2022; Taylor et al., 2025). Although the initial costs such as training staff on advanced cessation counselling may seem high, the evidence indicates that these expenses can be regained through the fewer resource intensive interventions in the future (Brown et al., 2023).  Hence, the integration of nurse led cessation with other financial and service delivery aspects is being appreciated, which in turn supports the importance of prevention as a care strategy (NHS England, 2019).



 There is also growing evidence of the professional and workforce advantages of including smoking cessation into usual nursing practice.  Several studies have established that there is an improvement in nurses’ job satisfaction and perceived professional efficacy when they are offered systematic and evidence informed cessation interventions and when they are encouraged by their managers (Rice et al., 2017; Brown et al., 2023). Malloch and Porter-O’Grady (2023) in their work propose that smoking cessation should be incorporated in the nursing education and in service training to ensure that the nurses are equipped to implement the interventions in the busy hospitals. Encouragingly, those who have been able to assist patients in quitting often have better morale, which is positive feedback that can help in sustaining these programmes (Taylor et al., 2025).



Additionally, the concept of person-centred care which means that interventions should be individualized based on the patient’s drivers, socio economic status, and other illnesses was also observed to be a common trend (Aveyard and Sharp, 2023; Ellis, 2021). For instance, to address the specific problems that are faced by people with mental health problems or those from poor backgrounds, more resources such as community health workers and tele health follow up may be required (Hartmann-Boyce et al., 2021; Standing, 2023). When a holistic approach is used, the nurse led interventions have been found to be more effective and have lower relapse rates, which is in line with the overall aims of patient centred care and health equality (McDermott et al., 2020).

Time, staffing, and other clinical issues can prevent nurses from implementing full cessation programs (Slattery et al., 2016). This paper has discussed the need for resource allocation and organizational commitment to overcome these barriers, especially since post admission early intervention is crucial. Also, the continuity of nurse led interventions is dependent on well-defined organizational policies, funding, and nurse education as well as policy support (Cahill et al., 2016; Smith and Johnson, 2024). By eradicating these barriers, healthcare facilities can enhance the effectiveness of hospital-based interventions which in turn will assist in reducing the prevalence of smoking and improving the quality of life of patients across the country.
This dissertation provides evidence that demonstrates early implementation of person-specific nursing interventions leads to better patient outcomes than traditional nursing practices. These interventions produce higher smoking cessation results and economic benefits which match the NHS goals for preventive healthcare and resource management (NHS England, 2019; Royal College of Nursing, 2022). These programs will establish themselves as fundamental elements of modern healthcare delivery through ongoing research and institutional backing along with thorough nurse training which tackles the ongoing smoking problem and builds a patient-centred care environment.
